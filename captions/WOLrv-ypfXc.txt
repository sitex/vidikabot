[00:00:00] Eric Schmidt gave a facety talk at
[00:00:02] Stanford just a few days ago about AI he
[00:00:05] was of course the former Google CEO and
[00:00:08] perceived by people as a bit of a
[00:00:10] futurist he&#39;s able to kind of often very
[00:00:12] accurately predict where technology is
[00:00:14] going the interview was over an hour
[00:00:16] long and it was fascinating covering
[00:00:18] topics like ai ai agents where this
[00:00:20] whole thing is going Etc and had a lot
[00:00:22] of pretty brilliant insights by Eric
[00:00:25] into where he believes this is going but
[00:00:28] unfortunately at our plus long interview
[00:00:30] there was just one comment that people
[00:00:32] didn&#39;t like the media machine went into
[00:00:35] overdrive mode and the video has been
[00:00:38] basically taken down it&#39;s no longer
[00:00:40] available to see it was deemed too hot
[00:00:43] for the internet and no longer available
[00:00:45] but just between you and me and keep
[00:00:48] this on the DL please I might have a
[00:00:51] copy of it maybe allegedly I feel like I
[00:00:54] need to say something here that reduces
[00:00:55] my liability some sort of a legal
[00:00:58] statement like I take no resp
[00:00:59] responsibility for my actions yeah that
[00:01:01] should do subscribe for more sweet AI
[00:01:03] content let&#39;s take a look at a few clips
[00:01:05] from this Stanford lecture by Eric
[00:01:08] Schmidt about AI I think you will like
[00:01:10] it if you do hit that thumbs up please
[00:01:13] because this is somebody that has a bit
[00:01:14] of a Clairvoyance about the future of
[00:01:16] tech he tends to see how things will
[00:01:18] unfold with startling accuracy so before
[00:01:21] he starts talking he asks the class to
[00:01:23] basically Define what a context window
[00:01:25] is and what AI agents are context
[00:01:28] Windows of course you can think of it as
[00:01:29] sort of a short-term memory it&#39;s
[00:01:31] basically the amount of words that a
[00:01:33] large language model can read and also
[00:01:36] write and output and kind of interact
[00:01:38] with right so if it has a large context
[00:01:40] window you can give it a whole book and
[00:01:42] then ask it questions about the book if
[00:01:44] it has a very short context window we
[00:01:46] might start answering a question and
[00:01:47] then halfway through forget what I was
[00:01:49] talking about it would be kind of a
[00:01:50] whoops I run out of memory type of thing
[00:01:52] and AI agents are things they can sort
[00:01:55] of complete tasks on your behalf you can
[00:01:56] tell them to go order something off of
[00:01:58] Amazon they&#39;ll go they&#39;ll search they&#39;ll
[00:02:00] do reviews they&#39;ll check the sizes the
[00:02:02] colors whatever and then order it and
[00:02:04] then report that they&#39;ve done it back to
[00:02:05] you so you can think of it as kind of a
[00:02:07] smart intern that&#39;s online that&#39;s Ai and
[00:02:10] Eric is talking about potentially a
[00:02:11] seeing a 10 million token context window
[00:02:15] sometime soon potentially in next two
[00:02:17] years or so he doesn&#39;t specify a
[00:02:19] timeline but soon so the first thing he
[00:02:21] talks about is what are we going to
[00:02:23] expect to happen in the next 2 to 5
[00:02:26] years so in the short term specifically
[00:02:29] at the intersection of something like a
[00:02:31] 10 million token context window and
[00:02:33] improving autonomous AI agents take a
[00:02:35] listen so an agent is something that
[00:02:37] does that does some kind of a task
[00:02:39] another definition would be that it&#39;s an
[00:02:40] LM State and memory okay can anybody
[00:02:44] again scientist can can any of you
[00:02:45] define text action taking text and
[00:02:47] turning into an action right here go
[00:02:48] ahead yes instead of taking text and
[00:02:50] turning it into more text more text
[00:02:52] taking text and have the AI trigger
[00:02:54] actions based so another definition
[00:02:56] would be language to python a pro
[00:02:59] programming language I never wanted to
[00:03:00] see survive and and everything in AI is
[00:03:02] being done in Python there&#39;s a new
[00:03:03] language called Mojo that has just come
[00:03:05] out which looks like they finally have
[00:03:06] addressed AI programming but we&#39;ll see
[00:03:07] if that actually survives over the
[00:03:08] dominance of python um one more
[00:03:10] technical question why is NVIDIA worth2
[00:03:12] trillion doll and the other companies
[00:03:14] are struggling technical answer I mean I
[00:03:16] think it just boils down to like most of
[00:03:17] code needs to run with C optimizations
[00:03:19] that currently only support so other
[00:03:21] companies can make whatever they want to
[00:03:22] but unless they have the 10 years of
[00:03:24] software there you don&#39;t have the
[00:03:25] machine learning optimization I like to
[00:03:27] think of Cuda as the C programming
[00:03:29] language for
[00:03:30] yeah right that&#39;s the way I like to
[00:03:31] think of it was founded in 2008 I always
[00:03:32] thought it was a terrible language and
[00:03:34] yet it&#39;s become dominant there&#39;s another
[00:03:35] Insight there&#39;s a set of Open Source
[00:03:36] libraries which are highly optimized to
[00:03:38] Cuda and not anything else and everybody
[00:03:39] who builds all these Stacks right this
[00:03:41] is completely missed in any of the
[00:03:42] discussions right the com it&#39;s
[00:03:44] technically called VM and a whole bunch
[00:03:45] of libraries like that highly optimized
[00:03:47] Cuda very hard to replicate that if
[00:03:48] you&#39;re a competitor so what does all
[00:03:50] this mean in the next year you&#39;re going
[00:03:52] to see very large context Windows agents
[00:03:56] and text action when they are delivered
[00:03:58] at scale it&#39;s going to have an impact on
[00:03:59] world at a scale that no one understands
[00:04:01] yet much bigger than the horrific impact
[00:04:03] we&#39;ve had on by social media right in my
[00:04:05] view so here&#39;s why in a context window
[00:04:07] you can basically use that as short-term
[00:04:08] memory and I was shocked that context
[00:04:11] Windows get this long the technical
[00:04:12] reasons have to do with the fact that
[00:04:13] it&#39;s hard to serve hard to calculate and
[00:04:14] so forth the interesting thing about
[00:04:15] short-term memory when you feed the you
[00:04:18] ask a question read 20 books you give it
[00:04:20] the text of the books is the query and
[00:04:22] you say tell me what they say it forgets
[00:04:23] the middle which is exactly how human
[00:04:25] brains work too right that&#39;s where we
[00:04:26] are with respect to agents there are
[00:04:28] people who are now building essentially
[00:04:30] llm agents and the way they do it is
[00:04:31] they read something like chemistry they
[00:04:33] discover the principles of chemistry and
[00:04:34] then they test it and then they add that
[00:04:36] back into their understanding right
[00:04:38] that&#39;s extremely powerful and then the
[00:04:40] third thing as I mentioned is text
[00:04:41] action so I&#39;ll give you an example the
[00:04:43] government is in the process of trying
[00:04:45] to ban Tik to we&#39;ll see if that actually
[00:04:46] happens if Tik Tok is banned here&#39;s what
[00:04:48] I propose each and every one of you do
[00:04:49] say to your L the foll make me a copy of
[00:04:53] Tik Tok steal all the users steal all
[00:04:55] the music put my preferences in it
[00:04:57] produce this program in the next 30
[00:04:59] seconds release it and in one hour if
[00:05:01] it&#39;s not viral do something different
[00:05:03] along the same lines that&#39;s the command
[00:05:05] boom boom boom boom right you understand
[00:05:08] how powerful that is if you could go
[00:05:09] from arbitrary language to arbitrary
[00:05:11] digital command which is essentially
[00:05:12] what python in this scenario is imagine
[00:05:14] that each and every human on the planet
[00:05:16] has their own programmer that actually
[00:05:18] does what they want as opposed to the
[00:05:18] programmers that work for me who don&#39;t
[00:05:20] do what I ask or potentially a whole
[00:05:22] Army of AI influencers each with its own
[00:05:25] little tweak that are completely managed
[00:05:28] by these AI agents trying to fill a
[00:05:30] certain Niche a certain Gap a certain
[00:05:32] personality type you can have an
[00:05:34] infinite amount of them boasting 24
[00:05:36] hours a day the programmers here know
[00:05:38] what I&#39;m talking about so imagine a non-
[00:05:39] arrogant programmer that actually does
[00:05:41] what you want and you don&#39;t have to pay
[00:05:42] all that money to and there&#39;s infinite
[00:05:44] supply of these program this is all
[00:05:45] within the next year or two very soon
[00:05:47] those three things and I&#39;m quite
[00:05:49] convinced it&#39;s the union of those three
[00:05:50] things that will happen in the next wave
[00:05:53] so you asked about what else is going to
[00:05:54] happen um every six months I oscillate
[00:05:57] so we&#39;re on a it&#39;s an even odd
[00:05:58] oscillation the moment the gap between
[00:06:01] the frontier models which they&#39;re now
[00:06:02] only three I&#39;ll ref few who they are and
[00:06:05] everybody else appears to me to be
[00:06:06] getting larger six months ago I was
[00:06:08] convinced that the Gap was getting
[00:06:09] smaller so I invested lots of money in
[00:06:10] the little companies now I&#39;m not so sure
[00:06:13] and I&#39;m talking to the big companies and
[00:06:14] the big companies are telling me that
[00:06:15] they need 10 billion 20 billion 50
[00:06:18] billion 100 billion is 100 billion right
[00:06:21] they very very hard I talked Sam
[00:06:23] Stargate is Microsoft and open AI sort
[00:06:26] of co- project where they plan to invest
[00:06:28] a 100 billion into a Data Center and by
[00:06:31] the way that&#39;s not the only project
[00:06:33] where they&#39;re kind of working together
[00:06:34] the other one is the power plant the
[00:06:37] fusion power plant somewhere near
[00:06:39] Seattle Washington in that area that
[00:06:42] they hope could potentially provide a
[00:06:43] lot of you know maybe not unlimited
[00:06:45] energy but clean cheap inexpensive
[00:06:48] energy to power a lot of the stuff next
[00:06:50] he&#39;s talking about what he and Sam Alpin
[00:06:52] talked about Sam Alman is a close friend
[00:06:54] he believes it&#39;s going to take about 300
[00:06:56] billion maybe more I pointed out to him
[00:06:58] that I done the calculation on the
[00:06:59] amount of energy required and I and I
[00:07:02] then in the spirit of full disclosure
[00:07:03] went to the White House on Friday and
[00:07:04] told them that we need to become best
[00:07:06] friends with Canada because Canada has
[00:07:08] really nice people helped invent Ai and
[00:07:10] lots of hydrop power because we as a
[00:07:12] country do not have enough power to do
[00:07:13] this keep in mind too that there&#39;s a lot
[00:07:15] of sort of heat generated in these
[00:07:17] processes so the need to cool these
[00:07:20] buildings these infrastructures you know
[00:07:23] if you&#39;re running it somewhere where
[00:07:24] it&#39;s hot you also have to consider your
[00:07:26] AC Bill running it somewhere where it&#39;s
[00:07:28] naturally cold old could be very you
[00:07:31] know profitable you would greatly slash
[00:07:33] your costs because you don&#39;t have to
[00:07:34] worry about cooling or at least not as
[00:07:37] much the alternative is to have the
[00:07:39] Arabs fund it and I like the Arabs
[00:07:40] personally I spent lots of time there
[00:07:42] right but they&#39;re not going to adhere to
[00:07:43] our national security rules whereas
[00:07:44] Canada and the US are part of a trit
[00:07:46] where that we all so the1 billion $300
[00:07:48] billion data centers electricity starts
[00:07:49] becoming the scarce resource well but
[00:07:51] and by the way if you follow this line
[00:07:52] of reasoning why did I discuss Cuda and
[00:07:54] Nvidia if $300 billion is all going to
[00:07:56] go to Nvidia you know what to do in the
[00:07:57] stock market okay that&#39;s sounds like
[00:07:59] he&#39;s recommending people buy Nvidia not
[00:08:01] a stock recommendation I&#39;m not a
[00:08:03] licens well part of it so we&#39;re need a
[00:08:05] lot more chips but Intel is getting a
[00:08:07] lot of money from the US government
[00:08:08] AMD they&#39;re trying to build you know
[00:08:10] Fabs raise your hand if you have an
[00:08:12] Intel computer in your Intel chip in any
[00:08:14] of your Computing
[00:08:15] devices okay so much for the Monopoly
[00:08:19] well that that&#39;s that&#39;s the point though
[00:08:20] they once did have a monopoly absolutely
[00:08:21] and Nvidia has a monopoly now so are
[00:08:22] those barriers T like like Cuda is that
[00:08:24] is there something that other so I was
[00:08:26] talking to Percy Percy land the other
[00:08:27] day he&#39;s switching between tpus and
[00:08:29] Nvidia depending on what you can get
[00:08:30] access so for those who are not aware
[00:08:32] one big race that&#39;s happening right now
[00:08:34] is kind of the race to produce these
[00:08:37] chips that power AI growth and Nvidia
[00:08:40] has been kind of the I mean you can say
[00:08:41] the Undisputed leader in the field
[00:08:43] producing gpus graphical processing
[00:08:46] units and those have been very effective
[00:08:48] they kind of started with you know
[00:08:50] computer games acceleration because
[00:08:51] instead of running each process kind of
[00:08:53] independently finishing and running the
[00:08:55] next one which could create bottlenecks
[00:08:57] it runs them in parallel so for example
[00:08:59] if you&#39;re rendering and gain them on
[00:09:00] screen right you have some some crazy 3D
[00:09:03] game with solar rays and whatever that&#39;s
[00:09:05] running in you know 30 frames per second
[00:09:07] 60 frames per second you know what I
[00:09:08] mean you need to be able to Rend each
[00:09:10] pixel on the screen in real time you
[00:09:12] can&#39;t wait for it to get rendered you
[00:09:14] have to kind of render it all in
[00:09:16] parallel and gpus were really good at
[00:09:18] that that&#39;s part of the power of why
[00:09:20] Nvidia is so powerful as well as Cuda
[00:09:22] the programming language that they run
[00:09:24] on but we do have other alternatives for
[00:09:26] these AI chips the TPU the tensor
[00:09:29] processing unit is Google&#39;s creation
[00:09:31] recently we&#39;ve also seen Gro which is a
[00:09:34] something that they refer to as a
[00:09:35] language processing unit and lpu there&#39;s
[00:09:38] been some talk of neuromorphic chips
[00:09:41] which are more designed like the human
[00:09:42] brain they&#39;re not digital they&#39;re more
[00:09:44] analog but I don&#39;t know if any progress
[00:09:46] has been made in that field and it
[00:09:48] sounds like Sam Alman is cooking up a
[00:09:51] brand new chip that might eventually go
[00:09:53] on to compete with Nvidia that&#39;s still
[00:09:55] in the very early stages but that&#39;s the
[00:09:57] big question is NVIDIA continue to
[00:10:00] dominate or is somebody going to come
[00:10:01] out with something that&#39;s brand new and
[00:10:03] much much better for AI specifically cuz
[00:10:06] gpus aren&#39;t necessarily the best
[00:10:10] possible sort of architecture for AI
[00:10:14] they happen to be very good they happen
[00:10:15] to be the best thing we have right now
[00:10:17] but nothing&#39;s to say that some different
[00:10:19] architecture can&#39;t be a million times
[00:10:22] better just because it&#39;s built from
[00:10:23] scratch for AI inference and training
[00:10:26] absolutely and Nvidia has a monopoly now
[00:10:28] so are those barriers like like Cuda is
[00:10:30] that is there something that other so I
[00:10:32] was talking to Percy Percy the other day
[00:10:33] he&#39;s switching between tpus and Nvidia
[00:10:35] chips depending on what he can get
[00:10:36] access to because he doesn&#39;t have a
[00:10:38] choice if he had infinite money he would
[00:10:39] today he would pick the b200
[00:10:41] architecture out of Nvidia because it
[00:10:42] would be faster and I&#39;m not suggest I
[00:10:44] mean it&#39;s great to have competition i&#39;
[00:10:45] AMD and Lisa Su at create length they
[00:10:47] have built a a thing which will
[00:10:48] translate from um this Cuda architecture
[00:10:50] that you were describing to their own
[00:10:52] which is called rock it doesn&#39;t quite
[00:10:53] work yet they&#39;re working on it so Lisa
[00:10:55] Sue that&#39;s of AMD so one of the Nidia
[00:10:59] competitors AMD and Lisa Su great length
[00:11:01] they have built a a thing which will
[00:11:03] translate from um this Cuda architecture
[00:11:05] that you were describing to their own
[00:11:06] which is called roam it doesn&#39;t quite
[00:11:07] work yet that get transcribed as cud
[00:11:10] architecture but that&#39;s not what it is
[00:11:12] he&#39;s saying Cuda architecture cud da so
[00:11:14] the Nidia sort of architecture versus
[00:11:16] Rockham I&#39;m not familiar with that one I
[00:11:18] guess that&#39;s amd&#39;s version of Cuda U you
[00:11:21] were at Google for a long time and uh
[00:11:23] they invented the Transformer
[00:11:24] architecture it&#39;s all Peter&#39;s fault
[00:11:26] thanks to uh to brilliant people over
[00:11:27] there like Peter and Jeff and everyone
[00:11:29] um but now it doesn&#39;t seem like they&#39;re
[00:11:32] they kind of lost ini so I guess this is
[00:11:34] the part that caused all the hubub I&#39;m
[00:11:35] just skipping it I&#39;m not touching it
[00:11:37] it&#39;s not really related to AI
[00:11:39] necessarily unfortunately I think
[00:11:41] there&#39;s a lot of overlap with politics
[00:11:42] so I&#39;m just trying to avoid that but it
[00:11:44] seems like he&#39;s saying that it might be
[00:11:45] like a cultural issue but let&#39;s continue
[00:11:48] and see what else they&#39;ve talked about
[00:11:50] yes sir in terms of national security or
[00:11:52] interest have play a role or competition
[00:11:54] with China as well so I was the chairman
[00:11:56] of an AI commission that sort of looked
[00:11:57] at this very carefully and um you can
[00:11:59] read it it&#39;s about 752 pages and I&#39;ll
[00:12:01] just summarize it by saying we&#39;re ahead
[00:12:03] we need to stay ahead and we need lots
[00:12:04] of money to do so our customers were the
[00:12:05] senate in the house um and out of that
[00:12:08] came the chips act and a lot of other
[00:12:09] stuff like that um a rough scenario is
[00:12:12] that the chips act invested billions
[00:12:14] into building out the US infrastructure
[00:12:16] to develop AI chips and also I believe
[00:12:18] that&#39;s what limited a lot of the
[00:12:20] nvidia&#39;s export to China some of the
[00:12:23] best chips the most powerful chips it
[00:12:24] limited the exports to China how much
[00:12:27] they could ship and sell in China how it
[00:12:29] seems like that&#39;s creating a bit of a
[00:12:31] black market of people trying to import
[00:12:33] those into China through other means but
[00:12:36] if you assume the frontier models drive
[00:12:37] forward and a few of the open source
[00:12:39] models it&#39;s likely that a very small
[00:12:40] number of companies can play this game
[00:12:42] countries excuse me what are those
[00:12:43] countries or who are they countries with
[00:12:45] a lot of money and a lot of talent
[00:12:46] strong Educational Systems and a
[00:12:47] willingness to win the US is one of them
[00:12:49] China is another one how many others are
[00:12:51] there are there any
[00:12:52] others I don&#39;t know maybe but certainly
[00:12:55] the in your lifetimes the battle between
[00:12:57] the US and China for knowledge Supremacy
[00:12:59] is going to be the big fight right so
[00:13:01] the US government banned essentially the
[00:13:02] Invidia chips although they weren&#39;t
[00:13:03] allowed to say that was what they were
[00:13:04] doing but they actually did that into
[00:13:05] China um they have about a 10year chip
[00:13:08] advant we have a roughly 10e chip
[00:13:09] advantage in terms of subdv is sub five
[00:13:12] roughly 10 years wow um and so you&#39;re
[00:13:14] gonna have so an example would be today
[00:13:16] we&#39;re a couple of years ahead of China
[00:13:17] my guess is we&#39;ll get a few more years
[00:13:18] ahead of China and the Chinese are
[00:13:20] whopping mad about this it&#39;s like hugely
[00:13:21] upset about it so that&#39;s a big deal that
[00:13:23] was a decision made by the Trump
[00:13:24] Administration and furthered by the
[00:13:25] Biden Administration do you think that
[00:13:27] it&#39;s going to make that scale of
[00:13:28] investment I mean OB the chips act but
[00:13:29] beyond that build building a massive AI
[00:13:32] system so so as you know I I lead a an
[00:13:34] informal ad hoc non-legal group that&#39;s
[00:13:37] that&#39;s different from illegal exactly
[00:13:39] justar which includes all the usual
[00:13:41] which includes all The Usual Suspects
[00:13:43] yes and The Usual Suspects over the last
[00:13:44] year came up with basis of the reasoning
[00:13:46] that became the um uh uh the B
[00:13:49] administration&#39;s uh AI act which is the
[00:13:51] longest Presidential Directive in
[00:13:53] history you&#39;re talking the special
[00:13:53] competitive studies Pro no this is the
[00:13:55] actual the actual act from the executive
[00:13:58] office and there implementing the
[00:13:59] details so far they&#39;ve got it right and
[00:14:01] so for example one of the debates that
[00:14:02] we had for last year has been how do you
[00:14:05] detect danger in a system which has
[00:14:07] learned it but you don&#39;t know what to
[00:14:09] ask it okay so in other words it&#39;s a
[00:14:11] core it&#39;s a sort of a core problem it&#39;s
[00:14:12] learned something bad but it can&#39;t tell
[00:14:14] you what it learned and you don&#39;t know
[00:14:15] what to ask it and there&#39;s so many
[00:14:16] threats right like it learned how to mix
[00:14:18] chemistry in some new way but you don&#39;t
[00:14:19] know how to ask it and so people are
[00:14:21] working hard on that but we ultimately
[00:14:22] wrote in our memos to them that there
[00:14:24] was a threshold which we arbitrarily
[00:14:25] named as 10 to the 26 flops which
[00:14:27] technically is a measure of computation
[00:14:29] that that threshold you had to report to
[00:14:31] the government that you were doing this
[00:14:32] and that&#39;s part of the rule the EU to
[00:14:35] just make sure they were different did
[00:14:36] 10 to 25 yeah but it&#39;s all kind of close
[00:14:38] enough I think all of these distinctions
[00:14:39] go away because the technology will now
[00:14:41] the technical term is called Federated
[00:14:42] training where basically you can take
[00:14:43] pieces and Union them together so we may
[00:14:46] not be able to keep keep people safe
[00:14:48] from these new things well rumors are
[00:14:49] that that&#39;s how open ey has had to train
[00:14:50] partly because of the power uh
[00:14:51] consumption there&#39;s no one place where
[00:14:53] so this is interesting I haven&#39;t heard
[00:14:55] that specific terminology before so he&#39;s
[00:14:57] saying that you can kind of build
[00:14:58] different pie pieces of LMS or sort of
[00:15:00] AI systems you train those pieces
[00:15:02] separately and then you Union them
[00:15:05] together you glue them together we&#39;ve
[00:15:06] seen this with the recent paper
[00:15:08] published where you can take sort of the
[00:15:09] large smart model and a very like a
[00:15:11] cheaper faster model and have sort of
[00:15:14] another sort of gatekeeper another yet
[00:15:16] another a model that kind of chooses
[00:15:17] where it routes the questions to so
[00:15:20] certain questions need to be answered by
[00:15:21] the bigger model but there&#39;s a lot that
[00:15:23] can be answered just as effectively by
[00:15:26] the smaller model and so this model just
[00:15:27] routes them to the cheaper model when
[00:15:29] needed and the results have been
[00:15:31] astonishing because it&#39;s if I remember
[00:15:33] my numbers correctly it has shown in
[00:15:35] some cases to reduce the cost of running
[00:15:37] these things by 80% while maintaining
[00:15:40] something like 96% accuracy so for just
[00:15:43] and I don&#39;t recall those the exact
[00:15:45] numbers but it was some big big numbers
[00:15:46] like that so it&#39;s a tiny reduction in
[00:15:48] accuracy for a potentially massive
[00:15:51] reduction in cost so I&#39;m not sure if
[00:15:53] that&#39;s an example of specifically what
[00:15:55] he&#39;s talking about but this idea of
[00:15:56] Federated training sounds like it&#39;s
[00:15:58] training piece in individual sort of
[00:16:00] batches right and taking those pieces
[00:16:02] and then putting them together to create
[00:16:04] the final model next they&#39;re talking
[00:16:06] about war well let&#39;s talk to about a
[00:16:08] real war that&#39;s going on I know that uh
[00:16:10] something you&#39;ve been very involved in
[00:16:11] is uh the Ukraine war and in particular
[00:16:15] uh I know that uh something you&#39;ve been
[00:16:17] very involved in is uh the Ukraine war
[00:16:19] and in particular uh I how you talk
[00:16:21] about white stor and your your goal of
[00:16:23] having a 500,000 $500 drones destroy $5
[00:16:26] million tanks so Howes that changing
[00:16:28] Warfare I work for the Secretary of
[00:16:29] Defense for seven years and and tried to
[00:16:32] change the way we run our military I&#39;m
[00:16:34] I&#39;m not a particularly big fan of the
[00:16:35] military but it&#39;s very expensive and I
[00:16:36] wanted to see if I could be helpful and
[00:16:37] I think in my view I largely failed they
[00:16:38] gave me a medal so they must give medals
[00:16:41] to failure or you know whatever but my
[00:16:43] self-criticism was nothing has really
[00:16:44] changed and the system in America is not
[00:16:47] going to lead to real Innovation so
[00:16:49] watching the Russians use tanks to
[00:16:51] destroy apartment buildings with little
[00:16:52] old ladies and kids just drove me crazy
[00:16:54] so I decided to work on a company with
[00:16:55] your friend Sebastian thrun and as a
[00:16:57] former faculty member here and a bunch
[00:16:59] of Stanford people and the idea
[00:17:01] basically is to do two things use AI in
[00:17:03] complicated powerful ways for these
[00:17:04] essentially robotic War and the second
[00:17:06] one is to lower the cost of the robots
[00:17:07] now you sit there and you go why would a
[00:17:09] good liberal like me do that and the
[00:17:10] answer is that the whole theory of
[00:17:13] armies is tanks artilleries and Mort and
[00:17:15] we can eliminate all of them and we can
[00:17:17] make the penalty for invading a country
[00:17:18] at least by lamb essentially being
[00:17:20] impossible it should eliminate the kind
[00:17:22] of land battles well this this is Rel
[00:17:23] question is that does it give more of
[00:17:25] advantage to defense versus offense can
[00:17:26] you can you even make that distinction
[00:17:27] because I&#39;ve been doing this for the
[00:17:28] last year I&#39;ve learned a lot about war
[00:17:29] that I really did not want to know and
[00:17:31] one of the things to know about war is
[00:17:32] that the offense always has the
[00:17:33] advantage because you can always
[00:17:35] overwhelm the defensive systems and so
[00:17:37] you&#39;re better off as a strategy of
[00:17:38] National Defense to have a very strong
[00:17:40] offense that you can use if you need to
[00:17:42] and the systems that I and others are
[00:17:43] building will do that um because of the
[00:17:45] way the system works I now a licensed I
[00:17:47] think he might have misspoken there let
[00:17:48] me know in the comments if you think so
[00:17:50] too or I&#39;m missing something I think he
[00:17:52] meant to say that he will he and others
[00:17:54] like him will build incredible defensive
[00:17:57] systems to reduce the effectiveness of
[00:17:59] invading and using offensive systems
[00:18:01] that&#39;s how I&#39;m interpreting I think he
[00:18:03] kind of to me it sounds like he misspoke
[00:18:04] a little bit if if I understand
[00:18:05] correctly because of the way the system
[00:18:07] works I am now a licensed arms deer
[00:18:10] others are building we do that um
[00:18:11] because of the way the system works I am
[00:18:13] now a licensed arms dealer so computer
[00:18:15] scientist businessman arms dealer and
[00:18:19] I&#39;m sorry to agression I I don&#39;t know I
[00:18:21] do not recommend this in your Carew I
[00:18:22] stick with they are um and because of
[00:18:24] the way the laws work um we&#39;re doing
[00:18:25] this privately and then it&#39;s this is all
[00:18:27] legal with the support of the
[00:18:28] governments it goes straight into
[00:18:28] Ukraine and then they fight the war and
[00:18:30] and and without going into all the
[00:18:31] details things are pretty bad I think if
[00:18:33] in May or June if the Russians build up
[00:18:36] as they expecting to Ukraine will lose a
[00:18:38] whole chunk of its territory and will
[00:18:39] begin the process of losing the whole
[00:18:40] country so I believe this was recorded
[00:18:42] in August 2024 just a few days ago or at
[00:18:45] least that&#39;s when it was posted if you
[00:18:47] recall the news headlines about it all
[00:18:49] of them are from like a few hours ago so
[00:18:51] I think he&#39;s talking about 2025 I&#39;m
[00:18:54] assuming so he&#39;s talking about May or
[00:18:55] June of 2025 for most of History humans
[00:18:58] sort of had a mystical understanding of
[00:18:59] the universe and then there&#39;s the
[00:19:00] Scientific Revolution and the
[00:19:01] enlightenment um and in your article you
[00:19:03] argue that now these models are becoming
[00:19:05] so complicated and uh difficult to
[00:19:08] understand that we don&#39;t really know
[00:19:09] what&#39;s going on in them I&#39;ll take a
[00:19:11] quote from Richard fean he says what I
[00:19:12] cannot create I do not understand I saw
[00:19:13] this quote the other day but now people
[00:19:15] are creating things they do not that
[00:19:16] that they can create but they don&#39;t
[00:19:16] really understand what&#39;s inside of them
[00:19:17] is the nature of knowledge changing in a
[00:19:19] way are we gonna have to start just
[00:19:20] taking the word for these models without
[00:19:22] them able being able to explain it to us
[00:19:23] the analogy I would offer is to
[00:19:24] teenagers if you have a teenager you
[00:19:26] know that they&#39;re human but you can&#39;t
[00:19:27] quite figure out what they&#39;re thinking
[00:19:29] um but somehow we&#39;ve managed in society
[00:19:30] to adapt to the presence of teenagers
[00:19:32] right and they eventually grow out of
[00:19:33] that and this serious so it&#39;s probably
[00:19:35] the case we&#39;re going to have knowledge
[00:19:37] systems that we cannot fully
[00:19:38] characterize but we understand their
[00:19:40] boundaries right we understand the
[00:19:42] limits of what they can do and that&#39;s
[00:19:43] probably the best outcome we can get do
[00:19:44] you think we&#39;ll understand the limits we
[00:19:46] we&#39;ll get pretty good at it the
[00:19:47] consensus of my group that meets on
[00:19:49] every week is that eventually the way
[00:19:51] you&#39;ll do this it&#39;s called SOC called
[00:19:52] adversarial AI is that there will there
[00:19:54] will actually be companies that you will
[00:19:56] hire and pay money to to break your AI
[00:19:58] system so it&#39;ll be the r instead of
[00:19:59] human red teams which is what they do
[00:20:00] today you&#39;ll have whole companies and a
[00:20:02] whole industry of AI systems whose jobs
[00:20:04] are to break the existing AI systems and
[00:20:05] find their vulnerabilities especially
[00:20:07] the knowledge that they have that we
[00:20:08] can&#39;t figure out that makes sense to me
[00:20:09] it&#39;s also a great project for you here
[00:20:11] at Stanford because if you have a
[00:20:12] graduate student who has to figure out
[00:20:13] how to attack one of these large models
[00:20:15] and understand what it does that is a
[00:20:16] great skill to build the Next Generation
[00:20:18] so it makes sense to me that the two
[00:20:19] will travel together if that&#39;s something
[00:20:21] that interests you there&#39;s a Twitter SLX
[00:20:23] account Pini The prompter Who uh
[00:20:25] basically jailbreaks a lot of these
[00:20:27] models usually within a few days of
[00:20:28] their release so he&#39;s just of course one
[00:20:30] of uh many people that do sort of things
[00:20:33] like that he does it kind of simly for
[00:20:35] entertainment and for online media
[00:20:38] Clouts but if you think about it third
[00:20:40] party testing third party red teaming of
[00:20:43] AI models third party quality assurance
[00:20:45] right QA of these models as they roll
[00:20:48] out and have contact with consumers with
[00:20:50] businesses with organizations Etc as
[00:20:52] well as just with various infrastructure
[00:20:54] systems and factories automations Etc
[00:20:57] war of course that&#39;s going to be a Big
[00:20:58] Industry that doesn&#39;t really exist yet
[00:21:01] it it just is beginning to grow and yet
[00:21:04] that might be something interesting and
[00:21:06] profitable to get into if that&#39;s uh
[00:21:08] that&#39;s your cup of tea next he comments
[00:21:10] just a bit on adver serial AI you just
[00:21:13] mentioned adversarial I&#39;m wonder if
[00:21:15] elaborate on that more it seems to be
[00:21:16] besides obviously increase get more
[00:21:18] perform mod getting them to do what you
[00:21:20] want
[00:21:22] isue well you have to assume that the
[00:21:24] current hallucination problems become
[00:21:26] less right in as the technology gets
[00:21:28] better and so forth I&#39;m not suggesting
[00:21:29] it goes away and then you also have to
[00:21:31] assume that there are tests for efficacy
[00:21:33] so there has to be a way of knowing that
[00:21:34] the thing succeeded so in the example
[00:21:36] that I gave of the Tik Tok competitor
[00:21:37] and by the way I was not arguing that
[00:21:38] you should illegally steal everybody&#39;s
[00:21:39] music what you would do if you&#39;re a
[00:21:40] silicon value entrepreneur which
[00:21:41] hopefully all of you will be is if it
[00:21:43] took off then you&#39;d hire a whole bunch
[00:21:44] of lawyers to go clean the mess up right
[00:21:45] but if if nobody uses your product it
[00:21:47] doesn&#39;t matter that you stole all the
[00:21:48] content and do not quote me right right
[00:21:51] you&#39;re on camera that&#39;s right but you
[00:21:53] see my point in other words Silicon
[00:21:54] Valley will run these tests and clean up
[00:21:55] the mess and that&#39;s typically how those
[00:21:56] things are done so so my own View is
[00:21:58] that you&#39;ll see more and more um
[00:22:00] performative systems with even better
[00:22:02] test and eventually adversarial tests
[00:22:03] and that&#39;ll keep it within a box the
[00:22:05] technical term is called Chain of
[00:22:06] Thought reasoning and people believe
[00:22:07] that in the next few years you&#39;ll be
[00:22:09] able to generate a thousand steps of
[00:22:10] Chain of Thought reasoning right do this
[00:22:12] do this it&#39;s like building recipes right
[00:22:13] that the recipes you can run the recipe
[00:22:15] and you can actually test that It
[00:22:16] produced the correct outcome and that&#39;s
[00:22:17] how the system will work next they ask
[00:22:19] what&#39;s going to be driving AI progress
[00:22:20] is it more data more compute is it just
[00:22:23] like chips and Hardware the amounts of
[00:22:24] money being thrown around are
[00:22:26] mindboggling and um I&#39;ve chose I
[00:22:29] essentially invest in everything because
[00:22:30] I can&#39;t figure out who&#39;s going to win
[00:22:31] and the amounts of money that are
[00:22:33] following me are so large I think some
[00:22:35] of it is because the early money has
[00:22:36] been made and the big money people who
[00:22:37] don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing have to
[00:22:38] have an AI component and everything is
[00:22:40] now an AI investment so they can&#39;t tell
[00:22:41] the difference I Define ai as Learning
[00:22:43] Systems systems that actually learn so I
[00:22:44] think that&#39;s one of them the second is
[00:22:46] that there are very sophisticated new
[00:22:47] algorithms that are sort of post
[00:22:48] Transformers my friend my collaborator
[00:22:50] for a long time has invented a new non-
[00:22:51] Transformer architecture there&#39;s a group
[00:22:53] that I&#39;m funding in Paris that has
[00:22:54] claims to done the same thing so there&#39;s
[00:22:56] enormous invention there a lot of things
[00:22:57] at Stanford and the final thing is that
[00:22:59] there is a belief in the market that the
[00:23:01] invention of intelligence has infinite
[00:23:03] return so let&#39;s say you have you put $50
[00:23:05] billion of capital into a company you
[00:23:07] have to make an awful lot of money from
[00:23:08] intelligence to pay that back I mean
[00:23:10] when you phrase it like that it seems to
[00:23:11] make sense if you invent intelligence
[00:23:14] certainly that would have an infinite
[00:23:17] return so it&#39;s probably the case that
[00:23:18] we&#39;ll go through some huge investment
[00:23:20] bubble and then it&#39;ll sort itself out
[00:23:21] that&#39;s always been true in the past and
[00:23:23] it&#39;s likely to be true here and what you
[00:23:24] said earlier was you think that the
[00:23:26] leaders are pulling away from right now
[00:23:27] right now and and
[00:23:29] this is a really the question is roughly
[00:23:31] the following there&#39;s a company called
[00:23:32] mrr in France they done a really good
[00:23:34] job um and I&#39;m obviously an investor um
[00:23:36] they have produced their second version
[00:23:38] their third model is likely to be closed
[00:23:39] because it&#39;s so expensive they need
[00:23:41] revenue and they can&#39;t give their model
[00:23:42] away so this open source versus closed
[00:23:44] Source debate in our industry is huge
[00:23:46] and um my entire career was based on
[00:23:49] people being willing to share software
[00:23:50] in open source everything about me is
[00:23:52] open source much of Google&#39;s
[00:23:53] underpinnings were open source
[00:23:54] everything I&#39;ve done technically and yet
[00:23:56] it may be that the capital costs which
[00:23:57] are so immense fundamentally changes how
[00:23:59] software is built you and I were talking
[00:24:01] um my own view of software programmers
[00:24:03] is that software programmers
[00:24:04] productivity will at least double there
[00:24:05] are three or four software companies
[00:24:07] that are trying to do that I&#39;ve invested
[00:24:08] in all of them in and they&#39;re all trying
[00:24:10] to make software programmers more
[00:24:11] productive the most interesting one that
[00:24:12] I just met with is called augment and I
[00:24:14] always think of an individual programmer
[00:24:15] and they said that&#39;s not our Target our
[00:24:16] Target are these 100 person software
[00:24:17] programming teams on millions of lines
[00:24:19] of code where nobody knows what&#39;s going
[00:24:20] on that&#39;s a really good AI thing will
[00:24:22] they make money I hope so you mentioned
[00:24:24] that there&#39;s the combination of the
[00:24:25] context exension the agents and the text
[00:24:27] to action is going to unimaginable
[00:24:29] impacts first of all why is the
[00:24:31] combination important and second of all
[00:24:32] I know that you know you&#39;re not like a
[00:24:33] crystal ball and you can&#39;t necessarily
[00:24:35] tell the future but why do you think
[00:24:36] it&#39;s beyond anything that we could
[00:24:37] imagine I think largely because the
[00:24:38] context window allows you to solve the
[00:24:40] problem of recency the current models
[00:24:42] take a year to train roughly six six
[00:24:44] there 18 months six months of
[00:24:45] preparation six months of training six
[00:24:46] months of fine tuning so they&#39;re always
[00:24:47] out of date context window you can feed
[00:24:50] what happened like you can ask it
[00:24:51] questions about the uh the Hamas Israel
[00:24:53] war right in a context that&#39;s very
[00:24:55] powerful it becomes current like Google
[00:24:56] um in the case of Agents I&#39;ll give you
[00:24:58] an example I set up a foundation which
[00:24:59] is funding a nonprofit which starts
[00:25:01] there&#39;s a I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s
[00:25:02] Chemists in the room that I don&#39;t really
[00:25:03] understand chemistry there&#39;s a a tool
[00:25:05] called chro CW which was an LM based
[00:25:08] system that learned chemistry and what
[00:25:09] they do is they run it to generate
[00:25:10] chemistry hypotheses about proteins and
[00:25:12] they have a lab which runs the tests
[00:25:14] overnight and then it learns that&#39;s a
[00:25:16] huge acceleration accelerant in
[00:25:17] chemistry Material Science and so forth
[00:25:19] so that&#39;s that&#39;s an agent model and I
[00:25:21] think the text to action can be
[00:25:21] understood by just having a lot of sheet
[00:25:23] programmers right um and I don&#39;t think
[00:25:25] we understand what happens and this is
[00:25:26] again your area of expertise what happen
[00:25:28] happens when everyone has their own
[00:25:29] programmer I&#39;m not talking about turning
[00:25:30] on and off the lights you know I imagine
[00:25:32] another example um for some reason you
[00:25:34] don&#39;t like Google so you say build me a
[00:25:35] Google competitor yeah you personally
[00:25:37] you don&#39;t build me a Google competitor
[00:25:38] uh search the web build a UI make a good
[00:25:41] copy um add generative AI in an
[00:25:43] interesting way do it in 30 seconds and
[00:25:45] see if it works right so a lot of people
[00:25:49] believe that the incumbents including
[00:25:50] Google are vulnerable to this kind of an
[00:25:52] attack now we&#39;ll see there were a bunch
[00:25:53] of questions who were sent over by
[00:25:54] slider I want to give some of them
[00:25:55] upload so um here&#39;s one um we talked a
[00:25:57] little about this last year um how can
[00:25:58] we stop AI from influencing public
[00:25:59] opinion misinformation especially during
[00:26:00] the upcoming he&#39;s asked a bit about
[00:26:02] misinformation how can we prevent AI
[00:26:05] from causing misinformation he talks
[00:26:07] about how during his time working with
[00:26:08] YouTube that was a problem people would
[00:26:10] upload a video for profit for their own
[00:26:13] self-gain and as a result of
[00:26:15] misinformation he says well people could
[00:26:17] be hurt he even says people die so
[00:26:19] certainly that is a problem if you saw
[00:26:22] my yesterday&#39;s video about grock 2 and
[00:26:24] the images it generates they&#39;re very re
[00:26:26] looking and grock 2 does not seem to
[00:26:29] have any sort of safety rails in place
[00:26:31] it just generates whatever you ask for
[00:26:33] so heading into the selection certainly
[00:26:35] that could be an issue he talks a little
[00:26:37] bit about some sort of a digital
[00:26:38] authentication or a public key
[00:26:40] authentication basically if somebody
[00:26:42] like the president speaks there&#39;s some
[00:26:44] key that everybody else can verify
[00:26:46] saying okay this is him this is his
[00:26:48] original audio he mentions briefly that
[00:26:50] it&#39;s it seems like he&#39;s saying it&#39;s a
[00:26:51] shame that the American universities
[00:26:53] aren&#39;t getting as much resources for
[00:26:56] computes for Google cloud and other
[00:26:58] places like that and this explosion
[00:27:00] where all the big companies are
[00:27:01] basically gobbling up the available
[00:27:03] resources and so he&#39;s saying the right
[00:27:05] thing for us to do is to get them the
[00:27:07] resources they need to give the
[00:27:08] universities the compute the resources
[00:27:10] that they need to pursue research and
[00:27:12] development and all that stuff next they
[00:27:13] talk about automation who&#39;s getting
[00:27:15] replaced who&#39;s getting to be obsolete in
[00:27:18] the labor force so let&#39;s take a look at
[00:27:20] that really fast I&#39;ll defer to the real
[00:27:22] expert here uh as your amateur Economist
[00:27:24] taught by Eric um I I fundamentally
[00:27:27] believe that the the sort of college
[00:27:28] education High skills task will be fine
[00:27:30] because people will work with these
[00:27:31] systems I think the systems is no
[00:27:33] different from any other technology wave
[00:27:34] the dangerous jobs and the jobs which
[00:27:35] require very little human judgment will
[00:27:37] get replaced the next question is kind
[00:27:39] of like the global balance of AI power
[00:27:42] so the person asking the question
[00:27:43] specifically mentions us and China but
[00:27:46] as you see here Eric specifically
[00:27:48] focuses on India take a listen the most
[00:27:50] interesting country is India because the
[00:27:52] top AI people come from India to the us
[00:27:54] and we should let India keep some of its
[00:27:56] top talent not all of them but some of
[00:27:57] them um and they don&#39;t have the kind of
[00:27:58] training facilities and programs that we
[00:28:00] so richly have here to me India is the
[00:28:01] big swing state in that regard China&#39;s
[00:28:03] Lost it&#39;s not going to not going to come
[00:28:04] back they&#39;re not going to change the
[00:28:05] regime as much as people wish them to do
[00:28:07] Japan and Korea are clearly in our camp
[00:28:09] Taiwan is a fantastic country whose
[00:28:11] software is terrible so that&#39;s not gonna
[00:28:12] going to work um amazing hard and in the
[00:28:15] rest of the world there are not a lot of
[00:28:16] other good choices that are big German
[00:28:18] the Europe is screwed up because of
[00:28:19] Brussels it&#39;s not a new fact I spent 10
[00:28:20] years fighting them and I work really
[00:28:22] hard to get them to fix the the EU act
[00:28:24] and they still have all the restrictions
[00:28:26] that make it very difficult to do our
[00:28:27] kind of research in Europe my French
[00:28:28] friends have spent all their time
[00:28:29] battling Brussels and mcon who&#39;s a
[00:28:31] personal friend is fighting hard for
[00:28:33] this and so France I think has a chance
[00:28:34] I don&#39;t see I don&#39;t see Germany coming
[00:28:35] and the rest is not big
[00:28:36] enough yes ma&#39;am so I know you&#39;re an
[00:28:39] engineer by
[00:28:40] trainer um given the capabilities that
[00:28:43] you Enis these mod should we still spend
[00:28:44] Hing to yeah because because ultimately
[00:28:46] it&#39;s it&#39;s the old thing of why do you
[00:28:47] study English if you can speak English
[00:28:49] you get better at it right you really do
[00:28:50] need to understand how these systems
[00:28:51] work and I feel very strong yes sir yeah
[00:28:53] I&#39;m curious if you explore good answer
[00:28:55] distributed setting and I&#39;m asking
[00:28:56] because sure like making a large cluster
[00:28:58] but Ma are powerful there&#39;s a lot of
[00:28:59] small maches across the world so like
[00:29:01] you think like folding at home are a
[00:29:02] similar idea works for training yeah we
[00:29:04] look very hard this so the way the
[00:29:06] algorithms work is you have a very large
[00:29:07] Matrix and you have essentially a
[00:29:08] multiplication function so think of it
[00:29:10] as going back and forth and back and
[00:29:12] forth and these systems are completely
[00:29:13] limited by the speed of memory to CPU or
[00:29:15] GPU and in fact the next iteration of
[00:29:18] Nvidia chips has combined all those
[00:29:20] functions into one chip the chips are
[00:29:21] now so big that they glue them all
[00:29:22] together and in fact the package is so
[00:29:24] sensitive the package is put together in
[00:29:26] a clean room as well as the chip itself
[00:29:27] so the looks like supercomputers and
[00:29:29] speed of light especially memory
[00:29:31] interconnect really dominated so I think
[00:29:32] unlikely for a while is there a way to
[00:29:33] segment the element like so Jeff de last
[00:29:35] year when he spoke here talked about
[00:29:36] having these different parts of it you
[00:29:38] train separately and then kind of
[00:29:39] Federate them each you know in order to
[00:29:41] do that you&#39;d have to have 10 million
[00:29:42] such things and then you&#39;re the way you
[00:29:44] ask the questions would be too slow he&#39;s
[00:29:45] talking about eight or 10 12 not at Lev
[00:29:49] the back way back I know like after
[00:29:51] releas new yor time open using work for
[00:29:53] training do you think
[00:29:54] that&#39;s I used to do a lot of work on the
[00:29:56] music licensing stuff what I learned was
[00:29:58] that in the 60s there was a series of
[00:30:00] lawsuits that resulted in an agreement
[00:30:02] where you get a a stipulated royalty
[00:30:04] whenever your song is played even even
[00:30:06] they don&#39;t even know who you are so paid
[00:30:07] into a bank and my guess is it&#39;ll be the
[00:30:08] same thing there be lots of lawsuits and
[00:30:09] there&#39;ll be some kind of stipulated
[00:30:10] agreement which will just say you have
[00:30:12] to pay x per of whatever Revenue you
[00:30:14] have in order to use pass cap BMI cap
[00:30:16] BMI look them up it&#39;s long it will seem
[00:30:17] very old to you but I think that&#39;s how
[00:30:18] it will yes sir interesting like there&#39;s
[00:30:21] a few players that are dominating AI
[00:30:23] right they&#39;ll continue to dominate and
[00:30:24] they seem to overlap with the large
[00:30:25] companies that all the antitrust
[00:30:27] regulation is kind of focus on how do
[00:30:28] you see those two Trends kind of yeah
[00:30:30] like do you see Regulators breaking up
[00:30:31] these companies and how will that affect
[00:30:33] the yeah so in my career I helped
[00:30:36] Microsoft get broken up and it wasn&#39;t
[00:30:37] broken up and I fought fought for Google
[00:30:39] to not be broken up and it&#39;s not been
[00:30:40] broken up so it sure looks to me like
[00:30:41] the trend is not to be broken up um as
[00:30:43] long as the companies avoid being John D
[00:30:45] Rockefeller the senior and I studied
[00:30:46] this looked it up it&#39;s how antitrust law
[00:30:48] came I don&#39;t think the government is
[00:30:49] will act the re the reason you&#39;re seeing
[00:30:51] these large companies dominate is who
[00:30:52] has the capital to build these data
[00:30:54] centers right right so my friend Reed
[00:30:56] and my friend com
[00:30:58] two have we talked to you about the
[00:31:00] decision that they made to take
[00:31:01] inflection so I believe Mustafa he&#39;s
[00:31:02] talking about Mustafa siman who is the
[00:31:04] co-founder of Google Deep Mind friend
[00:31:06] Reed and my friend M coming next we two
[00:31:08] week have Reed talked to you about the
[00:31:10] decision that they made to take
[00:31:11] inflection and essentially PE part it
[00:31:12] into Microsoft basically they decided
[00:31:14] they couldn&#39;t raise the tens of billions
[00:31:15] of dollars is that number public that
[00:31:16] you mentioned earlier have
[00:31:18] have
[00:31:20] got we want
[00:31:24] this I was wondering where all this is
[00:31:26] going to leave countries where in b
[00:31:27] ipants in phun models and access to
[00:31:30] compu the rich get richer and the poor
[00:31:32] do the best they can um they&#39;ll have to
[00:31:34] the fact of the matter is this is a rich
[00:31:36] country&#39;s game right huge Capital lots
[00:31:38] of technically strong people strong
[00:31:39] government support right there are two
[00:31:41] examples there lots of other countries
[00:31:43] that have all sorts of problems they
[00:31:43] don&#39;t have those resources they&#39;ll have
[00:31:44] to find a partner they&#39;ll have to join
[00:31:46] with somebody else something like that I
[00:31:48] last we met you he&#39;s fairly blunt he&#39;s
[00:31:50] fairly straightforward he I think kind
[00:31:52] of calls it how he sees it and it really
[00:31:55] seems like he&#39;s not talking one side or
[00:31:56] the other he doesn&#39;t have he&#39;s not
[00:31:58] pumping his back so to speak so he&#39;s not
[00:32:00] saying the things that benefit his
[00:32:01] portfolio or whatever he&#39;s just like
[00:32:03] yeah this is how it&#39;s going to be this
[00:32:04] is how it works by default big companies
[00:32:06] are not going to broken up the rich get
[00:32:07] richer Etc and finally he&#39;s asked a
[00:32:10] little bit more about kind of the
[00:32:11] business and entrepreneur side of things
[00:32:13] if you&#39;re starting your own company you
[00:32:15] have a product idea what does that look
[00:32:16] like how do you develop it how do you
[00:32:18] create a lot of wealth with your own
[00:32:20] product here&#39;s his answer I want I think
[00:32:23] the last we met you you at hackathon at
[00:32:24] AGI house and I know you spent a lot of
[00:32:26] time helping like young people as they
[00:32:27] create a lot of wealth and you spoke
[00:32:28] very passionately about about wanting to
[00:32:30] to do that do you have any advice for
[00:32:31] folks here as they&#39;re building their
[00:32:32] they&#39;re writing their business PL for
[00:32:33] this class or policy proposals or
[00:32:34] research proposals um you know at this
[00:32:36] stage of the careers going forward well
[00:32:39] um I teach a class in the business
[00:32:40] school on this so you should come to my
[00:32:41] class um the I am struck by the speed
[00:32:44] which with which you can build
[00:32:46] demonstrations of new ideas so in that
[00:32:49] in one of the hack I did the winning
[00:32:51] team the command was fly the Drone
[00:32:53] between two towers and it was given a
[00:32:54] virtual drone space and it figured out
[00:32:56] how to fly the Drone what the word
[00:32:57] between them generated the code in
[00:32:58] Python and flew the Drone in the
[00:32:59] simulator through the tower I just it
[00:33:01] would have taken a week or two you know
[00:33:03] good professional programmers to do that
[00:33:05] um I&#39;m telling you that the ability to
[00:33:06] prototype quickly really you know part
[00:33:08] part of the problem being an
[00:33:09] entrepreneur is everything happens
[00:33:10] faster well now if you can&#39;t get your
[00:33:12] prototype built in a day using these
[00:33:14] various tools you need to think about
[00:33:16] that right because that&#39;s who your
[00:33:17] competitor is doing so I guess my
[00:33:18] biggest advice is when you start
[00:33:19] thinking about a company is find the
[00:33:20] right a business CL plan in fact you
[00:33:22] should ask the computer to write your
[00:33:23] business plan for you
[00:33:25] um talk about that after leave it and
[00:33:28] and but I think it&#39;s very important to
[00:33:30] prototype your idea using these tools as
[00:33:32] quickly as you can because you can be
[00:33:33] sure there&#39;s another person doing
[00:33:34] exactly that same thing in another
[00:33:36] company in another University in a place
[00:33:38] that You&#39; all right
[00:33:40] thank very cool so this piece was uh
[00:33:43] taken down so apparently it&#39;s not even
[00:33:44] online right now but hopefully those few
[00:33:47] little Clips give you glips about what
[00:33:49] he thinks of AI you know I&#39;ve kind of
[00:33:51] cut out all the pieces that I think
[00:33:53] caused the controversy or whatever that
[00:33:55] situation was I don&#39;t think it really
[00:33:56] had anything to do with AI or anything
[00:33:58] of of substance I mean maybe touched on
[00:34:01] some political issues but whatever this
[00:34:03] is a person with a lot of really
[00:34:05] technical background and even though
[00:34:07] he&#39;s more of like a business guy he is
[00:34:10] spoken of with a lot of respect by all
[00:34:12] the engineers and all the very highly
[00:34:14] technical people in the Bay Area in the
[00:34:16] Silicon Valley he&#39;s somebody that really
[00:34:17] understands the tech space looks like
[00:34:19] Forbes has him listed as having a netw
[00:34:21] worth of almost $24 billion he&#39;s good
[00:34:25] friends he said with Sam Alman president
[00:34:27] of France France sounds like he knows
[00:34:29] all the co-founders of various AI
[00:34:31] companies big and small I mean this is
[00:34:33] somebody that&#39;s very very on the inside
[00:34:35] this is somebody that knows where things
[00:34:37] are going so certainly when he says
[00:34:39] something I tend to listen I put a great
[00:34:41] deal of weight into what he&#39;s saying and
[00:34:43] what he&#39;s saying is this AI wave is just
[00:34:47] starting we have two massive countries
[00:34:49] two big countries with the capital and
[00:34:50] the talent and everything else that&#39;s
[00:34:52] needed that are vying for AI Supremacy
[00:34:54] the issues with the chips and the power
[00:34:56] and the data while those are bottlenecks
[00:34:59] it seems like they will slowly be
[00:35:01] perhaps even maybe not that slowly
[00:35:03] slowly but but be improved you mentioned
[00:35:05] building data centers and various other
[00:35:07] AI infrastructure in Canada potentially
[00:35:10] which makes a lot of sense if you think
[00:35:12] about it lots of open land tends to be
[00:35:14] colder which again you know Heating and
[00:35:17] the generation of heat and having to
[00:35:19] cool these facilities is a concern tons
[00:35:22] land very friendly government to the US
[00:35:24] you know in factorio how do you just
[00:35:26] like find a big chunk of the map where
[00:35:28] there&#39;s a lot of open land and you&#39;d
[00:35:30] build all your nuclear power plants
[00:35:32] you&#39;d build out your entire like
[00:35:34] electricity infrastructure there just
[00:35:36] have a cable going back to where you
[00:35:38] need electricity to be it begs the
[00:35:40] question is this the future of Canada
[00:35:42] I&#39;m only kidding of course folks but the
[00:35:45] more and more I think about it there is
[00:35:46] a lot of land it&#39;s close by and it&#39;s
[00:35:49] cold and certainly that would be
[00:35:51] phenomenal for the revenue of Canada to
[00:35:53] generate some sort of tax some sort of
[00:35:55] Revenue based on right one of the kind
[00:35:57] of superpowers building out the
[00:35:59] infrastructure it needs to stay dominant
[00:36:01] in the AI race right I mean they&#39;re
[00:36:03] talking about creating 100 billion doll
[00:36:06] data centers potentially even the
[00:36:08] estimates a size 300 billion so that&#39;s
[00:36:10] that&#39;s one company that&#39;s not even the
[00:36:12] US government supported projects that&#39;s
[00:36:15] just a publicly traded company doing
[00:36:17] that sounds like he&#39;s really believing
[00:36:19] in Nvidia and the power of Nvidia and
[00:36:21] it&#39;s Cuda sort of software that the
[00:36:24] chips run on and if I&#39;m understanding
[00:36:26] him correctly he&#39;s not really seeing any
[00:36:28] competition to that I mean there&#39;s some
[00:36:30] things in the Horizon maybe possibly but
[00:36:32] nothing yet so it sounds like a lot of
[00:36:35] this money like a lot of it will be
[00:36:36] flowing into Nvidia and of course this
[00:36:39] idea that as the context window expands
[00:36:41] it&#39;ll become more and more sort of
[00:36:44] similar to training in a sense that
[00:36:46] right if it takes a while to train up a
[00:36:47] model but it can do in context learning
[00:36:50] meaning that you&#39;re able to just upload
[00:36:51] books and stuff to the finished model
[00:36:53] it&#39;s able to learn from them which we&#39;ve
[00:36:54] seen that with Gemini they found a
[00:36:56] language that doesn&#39;t have an a lot of
[00:36:57] online presence only something like 24
[00:37:00] people in the world speak it but they
[00:37:01] have some notebooks and manuscripts and
[00:37:03] stuff like that they uploaded to gini
[00:37:05] the actual finished trained Gemini and
[00:37:08] that model was able to learn how to
[00:37:11] speak it how to create sentences in it
[00:37:13] it wasn&#39;t trained on it it would learned
[00:37:15] in context right so as the context
[00:37:18] window ramps up to 10 million tokens
[00:37:21] that certainly seems like it would
[00:37:22] change how we think about pre- and
[00:37:25] posttraining or in other words once the
[00:37:27] model is trained it doesn&#39;t stop
[00:37:29] learning if you wanted to learn about a
[00:37:31] specific thing that you wanted to learn
[00:37:33] about maybe it&#39;s you know you have a
[00:37:34] company or that that have millions of
[00:37:37] documents and procedures and stuff like
[00:37:39] that just kind of like everywhere but no
[00:37:41] one person understands all of it well in
[00:37:43] the past that was kind of useless it
[00:37:45] doesn&#39;t really help you but if you can
[00:37:47] upload it to a model like that all of a
[00:37:49] sudden it knows all those things about
[00:37:51] your company it can train people on it
[00:37:54] it can answer your questions it can kind
[00:37:55] of manage it update see if there&#39;s any
[00:37:58] conflicts anywhere in it so instead of
[00:38:00] training a brand new model on that you
[00:38:02] just use an existing model and upload
[00:38:04] that stuff into the 10 million token
[00:38:07] context window combine that with text to
[00:38:09] action which is another word I&#39;ve heard
[00:38:11] it before this phrase but it&#39;s not that
[00:38:14] often used I feel like but yeah I mean
[00:38:16] that&#39;s what agents are basically right
[00:38:18] it&#39;s text to action you type in impr
[00:38:21] prompt and it goes and does that action
[00:38:23] it does the thing you&#39;re asking it to do
[00:38:25] as they get better at long-term plan
[00:38:27] long-term reasoning and actually Deep
[00:38:29] Mind CEO de saabi is also just had an
[00:38:32] interview talking about something very
[00:38:34] very similar he&#39;s talking about this
[00:38:36] idea that as agents become better
[00:38:38] long-term reasoners and planners they
[00:38:40] will become better and better at
[00:38:42] carrying out those long Horizon tasks
[00:38:44] and he&#39;s saying we&#39;re not ready for it
[00:38:46] when everybody can have these qualified
[00:38:49] capable agents right he&#39;s saying it&#39;s
[00:38:51] going to have an impact on the world at
[00:38:53] a scale no one understands yet and that
[00:38:56] certainly I think is true that&#39;s
[00:38:58] certainly something that I fully agree
[00:39:00] with a lot of our social structures and
[00:39:03] stuff we&#39;re kind of used to will have to
[00:39:05] change and of course he&#39;s saying if
[00:39:06] you&#39;re worried about losing your job
[00:39:08] having a degree that&#39;s going to become
[00:39:09] worthless you know should you still
[00:39:11] learn to code he&#39;s saying business as
[00:39:13] usual there yes some easy simple jobs or
[00:39:16] maybe very dangerous jobs jobs where
[00:39:18] there&#39;s not a lot of hard decisions to
[00:39:20] be made yes those might go away and yes
[00:39:23] these AIS might be pretty good at coding
[00:39:25] creating projects but learning all those
[00:39:27] skills getting better at those skills
[00:39:28] learning how everything works that&#39;s
[00:39:30] that&#39;s not going out of fashion that&#39;s
[00:39:32] never going to just disappear his
[00:39:34] example was you know if you can speak
[00:39:36] English why would you learn English
[00:39:38] right why would you study English well
[00:39:40] it&#39;s to get better at it to improve your
[00:39:42] abilities with it so I hope you enjoyed
[00:39:44] that make sure you subscribed please
[00:39:46] give me a thumbs up if you enjoyed it my
[00:39:48] name is Wes rth and I&#39;ll see you next
[00:39:49] time thank you for watching
[00:00:00] Eric Schmidt gave a facety talk at
[00:00:02] Stanford just a few days ago about AI he
[00:00:05] was of course the former Google CEO and
[00:00:08] perceived by people as a bit of a
[00:00:10] futurist he&#39;s able to kind of often very
[00:00:12] accurately predict where technology is
[00:00:14] going the interview was over an hour
[00:00:16] long and it was fascinating covering
[00:00:18] topics like ai ai agents where this
[00:00:20] whole thing is going Etc and had a lot
[00:00:22] of pretty brilliant insights by Eric
[00:00:25] into where he believes this is going but
[00:00:28] unfortunately at our plus long interview
[00:00:30] there was just one comment that people
[00:00:32] didn&#39;t like the media machine went into
[00:00:35] overdrive mode and the video has been
[00:00:38] basically taken down it&#39;s no longer
[00:00:40] available to see it was deemed too hot
[00:00:43] for the internet and no longer available
[00:00:45] but just between you and me and keep
[00:00:48] this on the DL please I might have a
[00:00:51] copy of it maybe allegedly I feel like I
[00:00:54] need to say something here that reduces
[00:00:55] my liability some sort of a legal
[00:00:58] statement like I take no resp
[00:00:59] responsibility for my actions yeah that
[00:01:01] should do subscribe for more sweet AI
[00:01:03] content let&#39;s take a look at a few clips
[00:01:05] from this Stanford lecture by Eric
[00:01:08] Schmidt about AI I think you will like
[00:01:10] it if you do hit that thumbs up please
[00:01:13] because this is somebody that has a bit
[00:01:14] of a Clairvoyance about the future of
[00:01:16] tech he tends to see how things will
[00:01:18] unfold with startling accuracy so before
[00:01:21] he starts talking he asks the class to
[00:01:23] basically Define what a context window
[00:01:25] is and what AI agents are context
[00:01:28] Windows of course you can think of it as
[00:01:29] sort of a short-term memory it&#39;s
[00:01:31] basically the amount of words that a
[00:01:33] large language model can read and also
[00:01:36] write and output and kind of interact
[00:01:38] with right so if it has a large context
[00:01:40] window you can give it a whole book and
[00:01:42] then ask it questions about the book if
[00:01:44] it has a very short context window we
[00:01:46] might start answering a question and
[00:01:47] then halfway through forget what I was
[00:01:49] talking about it would be kind of a
[00:01:50] whoops I run out of memory type of thing
[00:01:52] and AI agents are things they can sort
[00:01:55] of complete tasks on your behalf you can
[00:01:56] tell them to go order something off of
[00:01:58] Amazon they&#39;ll go they&#39;ll search they&#39;ll
[00:02:00] do reviews they&#39;ll check the sizes the
[00:02:02] colors whatever and then order it and
[00:02:04] then report that they&#39;ve done it back to
[00:02:05] you so you can think of it as kind of a
[00:02:07] smart intern that&#39;s online that&#39;s Ai and
[00:02:10] Eric is talking about potentially a
[00:02:11] seeing a 10 million token context window
[00:02:15] sometime soon potentially in next two
[00:02:17] years or so he doesn&#39;t specify a
[00:02:19] timeline but soon so the first thing he
[00:02:21] talks about is what are we going to
[00:02:23] expect to happen in the next 2 to 5
[00:02:26] years so in the short term specifically
[00:02:29] at the intersection of something like a
[00:02:31] 10 million token context window and
[00:02:33] improving autonomous AI agents take a
[00:02:35] listen so an agent is something that
[00:02:37] does that does some kind of a task
[00:02:39] another definition would be that it&#39;s an
[00:02:40] LM State and memory okay can anybody
[00:02:44] again scientist can can any of you
[00:02:45] define text action taking text and
[00:02:47] turning into an action right here go
[00:02:48] ahead yes instead of taking text and
[00:02:50] turning it into more text more text
[00:02:52] taking text and have the AI trigger
[00:02:54] actions based so another definition
[00:02:56] would be language to python a pro
[00:02:59] programming language I never wanted to
[00:03:00] see survive and and everything in AI is
[00:03:02] being done in Python there&#39;s a new
[00:03:03] language called Mojo that has just come
[00:03:05] out which looks like they finally have
[00:03:06] addressed AI programming but we&#39;ll see
[00:03:07] if that actually survives over the
[00:03:08] dominance of python um one more
[00:03:10] technical question why is NVIDIA worth2
[00:03:12] trillion doll and the other companies
[00:03:14] are struggling technical answer I mean I
[00:03:16] think it just boils down to like most of
[00:03:17] code needs to run with C optimizations
[00:03:19] that currently only support so other
[00:03:21] companies can make whatever they want to
[00:03:22] but unless they have the 10 years of
[00:03:24] software there you don&#39;t have the
[00:03:25] machine learning optimization I like to
[00:03:27] think of Cuda as the C programming
[00:03:29] language for
[00:03:30] yeah right that&#39;s the way I like to
[00:03:31] think of it was founded in 2008 I always
[00:03:32] thought it was a terrible language and
[00:03:34] yet it&#39;s become dominant there&#39;s another
[00:03:35] Insight there&#39;s a set of Open Source
[00:03:36] libraries which are highly optimized to
[00:03:38] Cuda and not anything else and everybody
[00:03:39] who builds all these Stacks right this
[00:03:41] is completely missed in any of the
[00:03:42] discussions right the com it&#39;s
[00:03:44] technically called VM and a whole bunch
[00:03:45] of libraries like that highly optimized
[00:03:47] Cuda very hard to replicate that if
[00:03:48] you&#39;re a competitor so what does all
[00:03:50] this mean in the next year you&#39;re going
[00:03:52] to see very large context Windows agents
[00:03:56] and text action when they are delivered
[00:03:58] at scale it&#39;s going to have an impact on
[00:03:59] world at a scale that no one understands
[00:04:01] yet much bigger than the horrific impact
[00:04:03] we&#39;ve had on by social media right in my
[00:04:05] view so here&#39;s why in a context window
[00:04:07] you can basically use that as short-term
[00:04:08] memory and I was shocked that context
[00:04:11] Windows get this long the technical
[00:04:12] reasons have to do with the fact that
[00:04:13] it&#39;s hard to serve hard to calculate and
[00:04:14] so forth the interesting thing about
[00:04:15] short-term memory when you feed the you
[00:04:18] ask a question read 20 books you give it
[00:04:20] the text of the books is the query and
[00:04:22] you say tell me what they say it forgets
[00:04:23] the middle which is exactly how human
[00:04:25] brains work too right that&#39;s where we
[00:04:26] are with respect to agents there are
[00:04:28] people who are now building essentially
[00:04:30] llm agents and the way they do it is
[00:04:31] they read something like chemistry they
[00:04:33] discover the principles of chemistry and
[00:04:34] then they test it and then they add that
[00:04:36] back into their understanding right
[00:04:38] that&#39;s extremely powerful and then the
[00:04:40] third thing as I mentioned is text
[00:04:41] action so I&#39;ll give you an example the
[00:04:43] government is in the process of trying
[00:04:45] to ban Tik to we&#39;ll see if that actually
[00:04:46] happens if Tik Tok is banned here&#39;s what
[00:04:48] I propose each and every one of you do
[00:04:49] say to your L the foll make me a copy of
[00:04:53] Tik Tok steal all the users steal all
[00:04:55] the music put my preferences in it
[00:04:57] produce this program in the next 30
[00:04:59] seconds release it and in one hour if
[00:05:01] it&#39;s not viral do something different
[00:05:03] along the same lines that&#39;s the command
[00:05:05] boom boom boom boom right you understand
[00:05:08] how powerful that is if you could go
[00:05:09] from arbitrary language to arbitrary
[00:05:11] digital command which is essentially
[00:05:12] what python in this scenario is imagine
[00:05:14] that each and every human on the planet
[00:05:16] has their own programmer that actually
[00:05:18] does what they want as opposed to the
[00:05:18] programmers that work for me who don&#39;t
[00:05:20] do what I ask or potentially a whole
[00:05:22] Army of AI influencers each with its own
[00:05:25] little tweak that are completely managed
[00:05:28] by these AI agents trying to fill a
[00:05:30] certain Niche a certain Gap a certain
[00:05:32] personality type you can have an
[00:05:34] infinite amount of them boasting 24
[00:05:36] hours a day the programmers here know
[00:05:38] what I&#39;m talking about so imagine a non-
[00:05:39] arrogant programmer that actually does
[00:05:41] what you want and you don&#39;t have to pay
[00:05:42] all that money to and there&#39;s infinite
[00:05:44] supply of these program this is all
[00:05:45] within the next year or two very soon
[00:05:47] those three things and I&#39;m quite
[00:05:49] convinced it&#39;s the union of those three
[00:05:50] things that will happen in the next wave
[00:05:53] so you asked about what else is going to
[00:05:54] happen um every six months I oscillate
[00:05:57] so we&#39;re on a it&#39;s an even odd
[00:05:58] oscillation the moment the gap between
[00:06:01] the frontier models which they&#39;re now
[00:06:02] only three I&#39;ll ref few who they are and
[00:06:05] everybody else appears to me to be
[00:06:06] getting larger six months ago I was
[00:06:08] convinced that the Gap was getting
[00:06:09] smaller so I invested lots of money in
[00:06:10] the little companies now I&#39;m not so sure
[00:06:13] and I&#39;m talking to the big companies and
[00:06:14] the big companies are telling me that
[00:06:15] they need 10 billion 20 billion 50
[00:06:18] billion 100 billion is 100 billion right
[00:06:21] they very very hard I talked Sam
[00:06:23] Stargate is Microsoft and open AI sort
[00:06:26] of co- project where they plan to invest
[00:06:28] a 100 billion into a Data Center and by
[00:06:31] the way that&#39;s not the only project
[00:06:33] where they&#39;re kind of working together
[00:06:34] the other one is the power plant the
[00:06:37] fusion power plant somewhere near
[00:06:39] Seattle Washington in that area that
[00:06:42] they hope could potentially provide a
[00:06:43] lot of you know maybe not unlimited
[00:06:45] energy but clean cheap inexpensive
[00:06:48] energy to power a lot of the stuff next
[00:06:50] he&#39;s talking about what he and Sam Alpin
[00:06:52] talked about Sam Alman is a close friend
[00:06:54] he believes it&#39;s going to take about 300
[00:06:56] billion maybe more I pointed out to him
[00:06:58] that I done the calculation on the
[00:06:59] amount of energy required and I and I
[00:07:02] then in the spirit of full disclosure
[00:07:03] went to the White House on Friday and
[00:07:04] told them that we need to become best
[00:07:06] friends with Canada because Canada has
[00:07:08] really nice people helped invent Ai and
[00:07:10] lots of hydrop power because we as a
[00:07:12] country do not have enough power to do
[00:07:13] this keep in mind too that there&#39;s a lot
[00:07:15] of sort of heat generated in these
[00:07:17] processes so the need to cool these
[00:07:20] buildings these infrastructures you know
[00:07:23] if you&#39;re running it somewhere where
[00:07:24] it&#39;s hot you also have to consider your
[00:07:26] AC Bill running it somewhere where it&#39;s
[00:07:28] naturally cold old could be very you
[00:07:31] know profitable you would greatly slash
[00:07:33] your costs because you don&#39;t have to
[00:07:34] worry about cooling or at least not as
[00:07:37] much the alternative is to have the
[00:07:39] Arabs fund it and I like the Arabs
[00:07:40] personally I spent lots of time there
[00:07:42] right but they&#39;re not going to adhere to
[00:07:43] our national security rules whereas
[00:07:44] Canada and the US are part of a trit
[00:07:46] where that we all so the1 billion $300
[00:07:48] billion data centers electricity starts
[00:07:49] becoming the scarce resource well but
[00:07:51] and by the way if you follow this line
[00:07:52] of reasoning why did I discuss Cuda and
[00:07:54] Nvidia if $300 billion is all going to
[00:07:56] go to Nvidia you know what to do in the
[00:07:57] stock market okay that&#39;s sounds like
[00:07:59] he&#39;s recommending people buy Nvidia not
[00:08:01] a stock recommendation I&#39;m not a
[00:08:03] licens well part of it so we&#39;re need a
[00:08:05] lot more chips but Intel is getting a
[00:08:07] lot of money from the US government
[00:08:08] AMD they&#39;re trying to build you know
[00:08:10] Fabs raise your hand if you have an
[00:08:12] Intel computer in your Intel chip in any
[00:08:14] of your Computing
[00:08:15] devices okay so much for the Monopoly
[00:08:19] well that that&#39;s that&#39;s the point though
[00:08:20] they once did have a monopoly absolutely
[00:08:21] and Nvidia has a monopoly now so are
[00:08:22] those barriers T like like Cuda is that
[00:08:24] is there something that other so I was
[00:08:26] talking to Percy Percy land the other
[00:08:27] day he&#39;s switching between tpus and
[00:08:29] Nvidia depending on what you can get
[00:08:30] access so for those who are not aware
[00:08:32] one big race that&#39;s happening right now
[00:08:34] is kind of the race to produce these
[00:08:37] chips that power AI growth and Nvidia
[00:08:40] has been kind of the I mean you can say
[00:08:41] the Undisputed leader in the field
[00:08:43] producing gpus graphical processing
[00:08:46] units and those have been very effective
[00:08:48] they kind of started with you know
[00:08:50] computer games acceleration because
[00:08:51] instead of running each process kind of
[00:08:53] independently finishing and running the
[00:08:55] next one which could create bottlenecks
[00:08:57] it runs them in parallel so for example
[00:08:59] if you&#39;re rendering and gain them on
[00:09:00] screen right you have some some crazy 3D
[00:09:03] game with solar rays and whatever that&#39;s
[00:09:05] running in you know 30 frames per second
[00:09:07] 60 frames per second you know what I
[00:09:08] mean you need to be able to Rend each
[00:09:10] pixel on the screen in real time you
[00:09:12] can&#39;t wait for it to get rendered you
[00:09:14] have to kind of render it all in
[00:09:16] parallel and gpus were really good at
[00:09:18] that that&#39;s part of the power of why
[00:09:20] Nvidia is so powerful as well as Cuda
[00:09:22] the programming language that they run
[00:09:24] on but we do have other alternatives for
[00:09:26] these AI chips the TPU the tensor
[00:09:29] processing unit is Google&#39;s creation
[00:09:31] recently we&#39;ve also seen Gro which is a
[00:09:34] something that they refer to as a
[00:09:35] language processing unit and lpu there&#39;s
[00:09:38] been some talk of neuromorphic chips
[00:09:41] which are more designed like the human
[00:09:42] brain they&#39;re not digital they&#39;re more
[00:09:44] analog but I don&#39;t know if any progress
[00:09:46] has been made in that field and it
[00:09:48] sounds like Sam Alman is cooking up a
[00:09:51] brand new chip that might eventually go
[00:09:53] on to compete with Nvidia that&#39;s still
[00:09:55] in the very early stages but that&#39;s the
[00:09:57] big question is NVIDIA continue to
[00:10:00] dominate or is somebody going to come
[00:10:01] out with something that&#39;s brand new and
[00:10:03] much much better for AI specifically cuz
[00:10:06] gpus aren&#39;t necessarily the best
[00:10:10] possible sort of architecture for AI
[00:10:14] they happen to be very good they happen
[00:10:15] to be the best thing we have right now
[00:10:17] but nothing&#39;s to say that some different
[00:10:19] architecture can&#39;t be a million times
[00:10:22] better just because it&#39;s built from
[00:10:23] scratch for AI inference and training
[00:10:26] absolutely and Nvidia has a monopoly now
[00:10:28] so are those barriers like like Cuda is
[00:10:30] that is there something that other so I
[00:10:32] was talking to Percy Percy the other day
[00:10:33] he&#39;s switching between tpus and Nvidia
[00:10:35] chips depending on what he can get
[00:10:36] access to because he doesn&#39;t have a
[00:10:38] choice if he had infinite money he would
[00:10:39] today he would pick the b200
[00:10:41] architecture out of Nvidia because it
[00:10:42] would be faster and I&#39;m not suggest I
[00:10:44] mean it&#39;s great to have competition i&#39;
[00:10:45] AMD and Lisa Su at create length they
[00:10:47] have built a a thing which will
[00:10:48] translate from um this Cuda architecture
[00:10:50] that you were describing to their own
[00:10:52] which is called rock it doesn&#39;t quite
[00:10:53] work yet they&#39;re working on it so Lisa
[00:10:55] Sue that&#39;s of AMD so one of the Nidia
[00:10:59] competitors AMD and Lisa Su great length
[00:11:01] they have built a a thing which will
[00:11:03] translate from um this Cuda architecture
[00:11:05] that you were describing to their own
[00:11:06] which is called roam it doesn&#39;t quite
[00:11:07] work yet that get transcribed as cud
[00:11:10] architecture but that&#39;s not what it is
[00:11:12] he&#39;s saying Cuda architecture cud da so
[00:11:14] the Nidia sort of architecture versus
[00:11:16] Rockham I&#39;m not familiar with that one I
[00:11:18] guess that&#39;s amd&#39;s version of Cuda U you
[00:11:21] were at Google for a long time and uh
[00:11:23] they invented the Transformer
[00:11:24] architecture it&#39;s all Peter&#39;s fault
[00:11:26] thanks to uh to brilliant people over
[00:11:27] there like Peter and Jeff and everyone
[00:11:29] um but now it doesn&#39;t seem like they&#39;re
[00:11:32] they kind of lost ini so I guess this is
[00:11:34] the part that caused all the hubub I&#39;m
[00:11:35] just skipping it I&#39;m not touching it
[00:11:37] it&#39;s not really related to AI
[00:11:39] necessarily unfortunately I think
[00:11:41] there&#39;s a lot of overlap with politics
[00:11:42] so I&#39;m just trying to avoid that but it
[00:11:44] seems like he&#39;s saying that it might be
[00:11:45] like a cultural issue but let&#39;s continue
[00:11:48] and see what else they&#39;ve talked about
[00:11:50] yes sir in terms of national security or
[00:11:52] interest have play a role or competition
[00:11:54] with China as well so I was the chairman
[00:11:56] of an AI commission that sort of looked
[00:11:57] at this very carefully and um you can
[00:11:59] read it it&#39;s about 752 pages and I&#39;ll
[00:12:01] just summarize it by saying we&#39;re ahead
[00:12:03] we need to stay ahead and we need lots
[00:12:04] of money to do so our customers were the
[00:12:05] senate in the house um and out of that
[00:12:08] came the chips act and a lot of other
[00:12:09] stuff like that um a rough scenario is
[00:12:12] that the chips act invested billions
[00:12:14] into building out the US infrastructure
[00:12:16] to develop AI chips and also I believe
[00:12:18] that&#39;s what limited a lot of the
[00:12:20] nvidia&#39;s export to China some of the
[00:12:23] best chips the most powerful chips it
[00:12:24] limited the exports to China how much
[00:12:27] they could ship and sell in China how it
[00:12:29] seems like that&#39;s creating a bit of a
[00:12:31] black market of people trying to import
[00:12:33] those into China through other means but
[00:12:36] if you assume the frontier models drive
[00:12:37] forward and a few of the open source
[00:12:39] models it&#39;s likely that a very small
[00:12:40] number of companies can play this game
[00:12:42] countries excuse me what are those
[00:12:43] countries or who are they countries with
[00:12:45] a lot of money and a lot of talent
[00:12:46] strong Educational Systems and a
[00:12:47] willingness to win the US is one of them
[00:12:49] China is another one how many others are
[00:12:51] there are there any
[00:12:52] others I don&#39;t know maybe but certainly
[00:12:55] the in your lifetimes the battle between
[00:12:57] the US and China for knowledge Supremacy
[00:12:59] is going to be the big fight right so
[00:13:01] the US government banned essentially the
[00:13:02] Invidia chips although they weren&#39;t
[00:13:03] allowed to say that was what they were
[00:13:04] doing but they actually did that into
[00:13:05] China um they have about a 10year chip
[00:13:08] advant we have a roughly 10e chip
[00:13:09] advantage in terms of subdv is sub five
[00:13:12] roughly 10 years wow um and so you&#39;re
[00:13:14] gonna have so an example would be today
[00:13:16] we&#39;re a couple of years ahead of China
[00:13:17] my guess is we&#39;ll get a few more years
[00:13:18] ahead of China and the Chinese are
[00:13:20] whopping mad about this it&#39;s like hugely
[00:13:21] upset about it so that&#39;s a big deal that
[00:13:23] was a decision made by the Trump
[00:13:24] Administration and furthered by the
[00:13:25] Biden Administration do you think that
[00:13:27] it&#39;s going to make that scale of
[00:13:28] investment I mean OB the chips act but
[00:13:29] beyond that build building a massive AI
[00:13:32] system so so as you know I I lead a an
[00:13:34] informal ad hoc non-legal group that&#39;s
[00:13:37] that&#39;s different from illegal exactly
[00:13:39] justar which includes all the usual
[00:13:41] which includes all The Usual Suspects
[00:13:43] yes and The Usual Suspects over the last
[00:13:44] year came up with basis of the reasoning
[00:13:46] that became the um uh uh the B
[00:13:49] administration&#39;s uh AI act which is the
[00:13:51] longest Presidential Directive in
[00:13:53] history you&#39;re talking the special
[00:13:53] competitive studies Pro no this is the
[00:13:55] actual the actual act from the executive
[00:13:58] office and there implementing the
[00:13:59] details so far they&#39;ve got it right and
[00:14:01] so for example one of the debates that
[00:14:02] we had for last year has been how do you
[00:14:05] detect danger in a system which has
[00:14:07] learned it but you don&#39;t know what to
[00:14:09] ask it okay so in other words it&#39;s a
[00:14:11] core it&#39;s a sort of a core problem it&#39;s
[00:14:12] learned something bad but it can&#39;t tell
[00:14:14] you what it learned and you don&#39;t know
[00:14:15] what to ask it and there&#39;s so many
[00:14:16] threats right like it learned how to mix
[00:14:18] chemistry in some new way but you don&#39;t
[00:14:19] know how to ask it and so people are
[00:14:21] working hard on that but we ultimately
[00:14:22] wrote in our memos to them that there
[00:14:24] was a threshold which we arbitrarily
[00:14:25] named as 10 to the 26 flops which
[00:14:27] technically is a measure of computation
[00:14:29] that that threshold you had to report to
[00:14:31] the government that you were doing this
[00:14:32] and that&#39;s part of the rule the EU to
[00:14:35] just make sure they were different did
[00:14:36] 10 to 25 yeah but it&#39;s all kind of close
[00:14:38] enough I think all of these distinctions
[00:14:39] go away because the technology will now
[00:14:41] the technical term is called Federated
[00:14:42] training where basically you can take
[00:14:43] pieces and Union them together so we may
[00:14:46] not be able to keep keep people safe
[00:14:48] from these new things well rumors are
[00:14:49] that that&#39;s how open ey has had to train
[00:14:50] partly because of the power uh
[00:14:51] consumption there&#39;s no one place where
[00:14:53] so this is interesting I haven&#39;t heard
[00:14:55] that specific terminology before so he&#39;s
[00:14:57] saying that you can kind of build
[00:14:58] different pie pieces of LMS or sort of
[00:15:00] AI systems you train those pieces
[00:15:02] separately and then you Union them
[00:15:05] together you glue them together we&#39;ve
[00:15:06] seen this with the recent paper
[00:15:08] published where you can take sort of the
[00:15:09] large smart model and a very like a
[00:15:11] cheaper faster model and have sort of
[00:15:14] another sort of gatekeeper another yet
[00:15:16] another a model that kind of chooses
[00:15:17] where it routes the questions to so
[00:15:20] certain questions need to be answered by
[00:15:21] the bigger model but there&#39;s a lot that
[00:15:23] can be answered just as effectively by
[00:15:26] the smaller model and so this model just
[00:15:27] routes them to the cheaper model when
[00:15:29] needed and the results have been
[00:15:31] astonishing because it&#39;s if I remember
[00:15:33] my numbers correctly it has shown in
[00:15:35] some cases to reduce the cost of running
[00:15:37] these things by 80% while maintaining
[00:15:40] something like 96% accuracy so for just
[00:15:43] and I don&#39;t recall those the exact
[00:15:45] numbers but it was some big big numbers
[00:15:46] like that so it&#39;s a tiny reduction in
[00:15:48] accuracy for a potentially massive
[00:15:51] reduction in cost so I&#39;m not sure if
[00:15:53] that&#39;s an example of specifically what
[00:15:55] he&#39;s talking about but this idea of
[00:15:56] Federated training sounds like it&#39;s
[00:15:58] training piece in individual sort of
[00:16:00] batches right and taking those pieces
[00:16:02] and then putting them together to create
[00:16:04] the final model next they&#39;re talking
[00:16:06] about war well let&#39;s talk to about a
[00:16:08] real war that&#39;s going on I know that uh
[00:16:10] something you&#39;ve been very involved in
[00:16:11] is uh the Ukraine war and in particular
[00:16:15] uh I know that uh something you&#39;ve been
[00:16:17] very involved in is uh the Ukraine war
[00:16:19] and in particular uh I how you talk
[00:16:21] about white stor and your your goal of
[00:16:23] having a 500,000 $500 drones destroy $5
[00:16:26] million tanks so Howes that changing
[00:16:28] Warfare I work for the Secretary of
[00:16:29] Defense for seven years and and tried to
[00:16:32] change the way we run our military I&#39;m
[00:16:34] I&#39;m not a particularly big fan of the
[00:16:35] military but it&#39;s very expensive and I
[00:16:36] wanted to see if I could be helpful and
[00:16:37] I think in my view I largely failed they
[00:16:38] gave me a medal so they must give medals
[00:16:41] to failure or you know whatever but my
[00:16:43] self-criticism was nothing has really
[00:16:44] changed and the system in America is not
[00:16:47] going to lead to real Innovation so
[00:16:49] watching the Russians use tanks to
[00:16:51] destroy apartment buildings with little
[00:16:52] old ladies and kids just drove me crazy
[00:16:54] so I decided to work on a company with
[00:16:55] your friend Sebastian thrun and as a
[00:16:57] former faculty member here and a bunch
[00:16:59] of Stanford people and the idea
[00:17:01] basically is to do two things use AI in
[00:17:03] complicated powerful ways for these
[00:17:04] essentially robotic War and the second
[00:17:06] one is to lower the cost of the robots
[00:17:07] now you sit there and you go why would a
[00:17:09] good liberal like me do that and the
[00:17:10] answer is that the whole theory of
[00:17:13] armies is tanks artilleries and Mort and
[00:17:15] we can eliminate all of them and we can
[00:17:17] make the penalty for invading a country
[00:17:18] at least by lamb essentially being
[00:17:20] impossible it should eliminate the kind
[00:17:22] of land battles well this this is Rel
[00:17:23] question is that does it give more of
[00:17:25] advantage to defense versus offense can
[00:17:26] you can you even make that distinction
[00:17:27] because I&#39;ve been doing this for the
[00:17:28] last year I&#39;ve learned a lot about war
[00:17:29] that I really did not want to know and
[00:17:31] one of the things to know about war is
[00:17:32] that the offense always has the
[00:17:33] advantage because you can always
[00:17:35] overwhelm the defensive systems and so
[00:17:37] you&#39;re better off as a strategy of
[00:17:38] National Defense to have a very strong
[00:17:40] offense that you can use if you need to
[00:17:42] and the systems that I and others are
[00:17:43] building will do that um because of the
[00:17:45] way the system works I now a licensed I
[00:17:47] think he might have misspoken there let
[00:17:48] me know in the comments if you think so
[00:17:50] too or I&#39;m missing something I think he
[00:17:52] meant to say that he will he and others
[00:17:54] like him will build incredible defensive
[00:17:57] systems to reduce the effectiveness of
[00:17:59] invading and using offensive systems
[00:18:01] that&#39;s how I&#39;m interpreting I think he
[00:18:03] kind of to me it sounds like he misspoke
[00:18:04] a little bit if if I understand
[00:18:05] correctly because of the way the system
[00:18:07] works I am now a licensed arms deer
[00:18:10] others are building we do that um
[00:18:11] because of the way the system works I am
[00:18:13] now a licensed arms dealer so computer
[00:18:15] scientist businessman arms dealer and
[00:18:19] I&#39;m sorry to agression I I don&#39;t know I
[00:18:21] do not recommend this in your Carew I
[00:18:22] stick with they are um and because of
[00:18:24] the way the laws work um we&#39;re doing
[00:18:25] this privately and then it&#39;s this is all
[00:18:27] legal with the support of the
[00:18:28] governments it goes straight into
[00:18:28] Ukraine and then they fight the war and
[00:18:30] and and without going into all the
[00:18:31] details things are pretty bad I think if
[00:18:33] in May or June if the Russians build up
[00:18:36] as they expecting to Ukraine will lose a
[00:18:38] whole chunk of its territory and will
[00:18:39] begin the process of losing the whole
[00:18:40] country so I believe this was recorded
[00:18:42] in August 2024 just a few days ago or at
[00:18:45] least that&#39;s when it was posted if you
[00:18:47] recall the news headlines about it all
[00:18:49] of them are from like a few hours ago so
[00:18:51] I think he&#39;s talking about 2025 I&#39;m
[00:18:54] assuming so he&#39;s talking about May or
[00:18:55] June of 2025 for most of History humans
[00:18:58] sort of had a mystical understanding of
[00:18:59] the universe and then there&#39;s the
[00:19:00] Scientific Revolution and the
[00:19:01] enlightenment um and in your article you
[00:19:03] argue that now these models are becoming
[00:19:05] so complicated and uh difficult to
[00:19:08] understand that we don&#39;t really know
[00:19:09] what&#39;s going on in them I&#39;ll take a
[00:19:11] quote from Richard fean he says what I
[00:19:12] cannot create I do not understand I saw
[00:19:13] this quote the other day but now people
[00:19:15] are creating things they do not that
[00:19:16] that they can create but they don&#39;t
[00:19:16] really understand what&#39;s inside of them
[00:19:17] is the nature of knowledge changing in a
[00:19:19] way are we gonna have to start just
[00:19:20] taking the word for these models without
[00:19:22] them able being able to explain it to us
[00:19:23] the analogy I would offer is to
[00:19:24] teenagers if you have a teenager you
[00:19:26] know that they&#39;re human but you can&#39;t
[00:19:27] quite figure out what they&#39;re thinking
[00:19:29] um but somehow we&#39;ve managed in society
[00:19:30] to adapt to the presence of teenagers
[00:19:32] right and they eventually grow out of
[00:19:33] that and this serious so it&#39;s probably
[00:19:35] the case we&#39;re going to have knowledge
[00:19:37] systems that we cannot fully
[00:19:38] characterize but we understand their
[00:19:40] boundaries right we understand the
[00:19:42] limits of what they can do and that&#39;s
[00:19:43] probably the best outcome we can get do
[00:19:44] you think we&#39;ll understand the limits we
[00:19:46] we&#39;ll get pretty good at it the
[00:19:47] consensus of my group that meets on
[00:19:49] every week is that eventually the way
[00:19:51] you&#39;ll do this it&#39;s called SOC called
[00:19:52] adversarial AI is that there will there
[00:19:54] will actually be companies that you will
[00:19:56] hire and pay money to to break your AI
[00:19:58] system so it&#39;ll be the r instead of
[00:19:59] human red teams which is what they do
[00:20:00] today you&#39;ll have whole companies and a
[00:20:02] whole industry of AI systems whose jobs
[00:20:04] are to break the existing AI systems and
[00:20:05] find their vulnerabilities especially
[00:20:07] the knowledge that they have that we
[00:20:08] can&#39;t figure out that makes sense to me
[00:20:09] it&#39;s also a great project for you here
[00:20:11] at Stanford because if you have a
[00:20:12] graduate student who has to figure out
[00:20:13] how to attack one of these large models
[00:20:15] and understand what it does that is a
[00:20:16] great skill to build the Next Generation
[00:20:18] so it makes sense to me that the two
[00:20:19] will travel together if that&#39;s something
[00:20:21] that interests you there&#39;s a Twitter SLX
[00:20:23] account Pini The prompter Who uh
[00:20:25] basically jailbreaks a lot of these
[00:20:27] models usually within a few days of
[00:20:28] their release so he&#39;s just of course one
[00:20:30] of uh many people that do sort of things
[00:20:33] like that he does it kind of simly for
[00:20:35] entertainment and for online media
[00:20:38] Clouts but if you think about it third
[00:20:40] party testing third party red teaming of
[00:20:43] AI models third party quality assurance
[00:20:45] right QA of these models as they roll
[00:20:48] out and have contact with consumers with
[00:20:50] businesses with organizations Etc as
[00:20:52] well as just with various infrastructure
[00:20:54] systems and factories automations Etc
[00:20:57] war of course that&#39;s going to be a Big
[00:20:58] Industry that doesn&#39;t really exist yet
[00:21:01] it it just is beginning to grow and yet
[00:21:04] that might be something interesting and
[00:21:06] profitable to get into if that&#39;s uh
[00:21:08] that&#39;s your cup of tea next he comments
[00:21:10] just a bit on adver serial AI you just
[00:21:13] mentioned adversarial I&#39;m wonder if
[00:21:15] elaborate on that more it seems to be
[00:21:16] besides obviously increase get more
[00:21:18] perform mod getting them to do what you
[00:21:20] want
[00:21:22] isue well you have to assume that the
[00:21:24] current hallucination problems become
[00:21:26] less right in as the technology gets
[00:21:28] better and so forth I&#39;m not suggesting
[00:21:29] it goes away and then you also have to
[00:21:31] assume that there are tests for efficacy
[00:21:33] so there has to be a way of knowing that
[00:21:34] the thing succeeded so in the example
[00:21:36] that I gave of the Tik Tok competitor
[00:21:37] and by the way I was not arguing that
[00:21:38] you should illegally steal everybody&#39;s
[00:21:39] music what you would do if you&#39;re a
[00:21:40] silicon value entrepreneur which
[00:21:41] hopefully all of you will be is if it
[00:21:43] took off then you&#39;d hire a whole bunch
[00:21:44] of lawyers to go clean the mess up right
[00:21:45] but if if nobody uses your product it
[00:21:47] doesn&#39;t matter that you stole all the
[00:21:48] content and do not quote me right right
[00:21:51] you&#39;re on camera that&#39;s right but you
[00:21:53] see my point in other words Silicon
[00:21:54] Valley will run these tests and clean up
[00:21:55] the mess and that&#39;s typically how those
[00:21:56] things are done so so my own View is
[00:21:58] that you&#39;ll see more and more um
[00:22:00] performative systems with even better
[00:22:02] test and eventually adversarial tests
[00:22:03] and that&#39;ll keep it within a box the
[00:22:05] technical term is called Chain of
[00:22:06] Thought reasoning and people believe
[00:22:07] that in the next few years you&#39;ll be
[00:22:09] able to generate a thousand steps of
[00:22:10] Chain of Thought reasoning right do this
[00:22:12] do this it&#39;s like building recipes right
[00:22:13] that the recipes you can run the recipe
[00:22:15] and you can actually test that It
[00:22:16] produced the correct outcome and that&#39;s
[00:22:17] how the system will work next they ask
[00:22:19] what&#39;s going to be driving AI progress
[00:22:20] is it more data more compute is it just
[00:22:23] like chips and Hardware the amounts of
[00:22:24] money being thrown around are
[00:22:26] mindboggling and um I&#39;ve chose I
[00:22:29] essentially invest in everything because
[00:22:30] I can&#39;t figure out who&#39;s going to win
[00:22:31] and the amounts of money that are
[00:22:33] following me are so large I think some
[00:22:35] of it is because the early money has
[00:22:36] been made and the big money people who
[00:22:37] don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing have to
[00:22:38] have an AI component and everything is
[00:22:40] now an AI investment so they can&#39;t tell
[00:22:41] the difference I Define ai as Learning
[00:22:43] Systems systems that actually learn so I
[00:22:44] think that&#39;s one of them the second is
[00:22:46] that there are very sophisticated new
[00:22:47] algorithms that are sort of post
[00:22:48] Transformers my friend my collaborator
[00:22:50] for a long time has invented a new non-
[00:22:51] Transformer architecture there&#39;s a group
[00:22:53] that I&#39;m funding in Paris that has
[00:22:54] claims to done the same thing so there&#39;s
[00:22:56] enormous invention there a lot of things
[00:22:57] at Stanford and the final thing is that
[00:22:59] there is a belief in the market that the
[00:23:01] invention of intelligence has infinite
[00:23:03] return so let&#39;s say you have you put $50
[00:23:05] billion of capital into a company you
[00:23:07] have to make an awful lot of money from
[00:23:08] intelligence to pay that back I mean
[00:23:10] when you phrase it like that it seems to
[00:23:11] make sense if you invent intelligence
[00:23:14] certainly that would have an infinite
[00:23:17] return so it&#39;s probably the case that
[00:23:18] we&#39;ll go through some huge investment
[00:23:20] bubble and then it&#39;ll sort itself out
[00:23:21] that&#39;s always been true in the past and
[00:23:23] it&#39;s likely to be true here and what you
[00:23:24] said earlier was you think that the
[00:23:26] leaders are pulling away from right now
[00:23:27] right now and and
[00:23:29] this is a really the question is roughly
[00:23:31] the following there&#39;s a company called
[00:23:32] mrr in France they done a really good
[00:23:34] job um and I&#39;m obviously an investor um
[00:23:36] they have produced their second version
[00:23:38] their third model is likely to be closed
[00:23:39] because it&#39;s so expensive they need
[00:23:41] revenue and they can&#39;t give their model
[00:23:42] away so this open source versus closed
[00:23:44] Source debate in our industry is huge
[00:23:46] and um my entire career was based on
[00:23:49] people being willing to share software
[00:23:50] in open source everything about me is
[00:23:52] open source much of Google&#39;s
[00:23:53] underpinnings were open source
[00:23:54] everything I&#39;ve done technically and yet
[00:23:56] it may be that the capital costs which
[00:23:57] are so immense fundamentally changes how
[00:23:59] software is built you and I were talking
[00:24:01] um my own view of software programmers
[00:24:03] is that software programmers
[00:24:04] productivity will at least double there
[00:24:05] are three or four software companies
[00:24:07] that are trying to do that I&#39;ve invested
[00:24:08] in all of them in and they&#39;re all trying
[00:24:10] to make software programmers more
[00:24:11] productive the most interesting one that
[00:24:12] I just met with is called augment and I
[00:24:14] always think of an individual programmer
[00:24:15] and they said that&#39;s not our Target our
[00:24:16] Target are these 100 person software
[00:24:17] programming teams on millions of lines
[00:24:19] of code where nobody knows what&#39;s going
[00:24:20] on that&#39;s a really good AI thing will
[00:24:22] they make money I hope so you mentioned
[00:24:24] that there&#39;s the combination of the
[00:24:25] context exension the agents and the text
[00:24:27] to action is going to unimaginable
[00:24:29] impacts first of all why is the
[00:24:31] combination important and second of all
[00:24:32] I know that you know you&#39;re not like a
[00:24:33] crystal ball and you can&#39;t necessarily
[00:24:35] tell the future but why do you think
[00:24:36] it&#39;s beyond anything that we could
[00:24:37] imagine I think largely because the
[00:24:38] context window allows you to solve the
[00:24:40] problem of recency the current models
[00:24:42] take a year to train roughly six six
[00:24:44] there 18 months six months of
[00:24:45] preparation six months of training six
[00:24:46] months of fine tuning so they&#39;re always
[00:24:47] out of date context window you can feed
[00:24:50] what happened like you can ask it
[00:24:51] questions about the uh the Hamas Israel
[00:24:53] war right in a context that&#39;s very
[00:24:55] powerful it becomes current like Google
[00:24:56] um in the case of Agents I&#39;ll give you
[00:24:58] an example I set up a foundation which
[00:24:59] is funding a nonprofit which starts
[00:25:01] there&#39;s a I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s
[00:25:02] Chemists in the room that I don&#39;t really
[00:25:03] understand chemistry there&#39;s a a tool
[00:25:05] called chro CW which was an LM based
[00:25:08] system that learned chemistry and what
[00:25:09] they do is they run it to generate
[00:25:10] chemistry hypotheses about proteins and
[00:25:12] they have a lab which runs the tests
[00:25:14] overnight and then it learns that&#39;s a
[00:25:16] huge acceleration accelerant in
[00:25:17] chemistry Material Science and so forth
[00:25:19] so that&#39;s that&#39;s an agent model and I
[00:25:21] think the text to action can be
[00:25:21] understood by just having a lot of sheet
[00:25:23] programmers right um and I don&#39;t think
[00:25:25] we understand what happens and this is
[00:25:26] again your area of expertise what happen
[00:25:28] happens when everyone has their own
[00:25:29] programmer I&#39;m not talking about turning
[00:25:30] on and off the lights you know I imagine
[00:25:32] another example um for some reason you
[00:25:34] don&#39;t like Google so you say build me a
[00:25:35] Google competitor yeah you personally
[00:25:37] you don&#39;t build me a Google competitor
[00:25:38] uh search the web build a UI make a good
[00:25:41] copy um add generative AI in an
[00:25:43] interesting way do it in 30 seconds and
[00:25:45] see if it works right so a lot of people
[00:25:49] believe that the incumbents including
[00:25:50] Google are vulnerable to this kind of an
[00:25:52] attack now we&#39;ll see there were a bunch
[00:25:53] of questions who were sent over by
[00:25:54] slider I want to give some of them
[00:25:55] upload so um here&#39;s one um we talked a
[00:25:57] little about this last year um how can
[00:25:58] we stop AI from influencing public
[00:25:59] opinion misinformation especially during
[00:26:00] the upcoming he&#39;s asked a bit about
[00:26:02] misinformation how can we prevent AI
[00:26:05] from causing misinformation he talks
[00:26:07] about how during his time working with
[00:26:08] YouTube that was a problem people would
[00:26:10] upload a video for profit for their own
[00:26:13] self-gain and as a result of
[00:26:15] misinformation he says well people could
[00:26:17] be hurt he even says people die so
[00:26:19] certainly that is a problem if you saw
[00:26:22] my yesterday&#39;s video about grock 2 and
[00:26:24] the images it generates they&#39;re very re
[00:26:26] looking and grock 2 does not seem to
[00:26:29] have any sort of safety rails in place
[00:26:31] it just generates whatever you ask for
[00:26:33] so heading into the selection certainly
[00:26:35] that could be an issue he talks a little
[00:26:37] bit about some sort of a digital
[00:26:38] authentication or a public key
[00:26:40] authentication basically if somebody
[00:26:42] like the president speaks there&#39;s some
[00:26:44] key that everybody else can verify
[00:26:46] saying okay this is him this is his
[00:26:48] original audio he mentions briefly that
[00:26:50] it&#39;s it seems like he&#39;s saying it&#39;s a
[00:26:51] shame that the American universities
[00:26:53] aren&#39;t getting as much resources for
[00:26:56] computes for Google cloud and other
[00:26:58] places like that and this explosion
[00:27:00] where all the big companies are
[00:27:01] basically gobbling up the available
[00:27:03] resources and so he&#39;s saying the right
[00:27:05] thing for us to do is to get them the
[00:27:07] resources they need to give the
[00:27:08] universities the compute the resources
[00:27:10] that they need to pursue research and
[00:27:12] development and all that stuff next they
[00:27:13] talk about automation who&#39;s getting
[00:27:15] replaced who&#39;s getting to be obsolete in
[00:27:18] the labor force so let&#39;s take a look at
[00:27:20] that really fast I&#39;ll defer to the real
[00:27:22] expert here uh as your amateur Economist
[00:27:24] taught by Eric um I I fundamentally
[00:27:27] believe that the the sort of college
[00:27:28] education High skills task will be fine
[00:27:30] because people will work with these
[00:27:31] systems I think the systems is no
[00:27:33] different from any other technology wave
[00:27:34] the dangerous jobs and the jobs which
[00:27:35] require very little human judgment will
[00:27:37] get replaced the next question is kind
[00:27:39] of like the global balance of AI power
[00:27:42] so the person asking the question
[00:27:43] specifically mentions us and China but
[00:27:46] as you see here Eric specifically
[00:27:48] focuses on India take a listen the most
[00:27:50] interesting country is India because the
[00:27:52] top AI people come from India to the us
[00:27:54] and we should let India keep some of its
[00:27:56] top talent not all of them but some of
[00:27:57] them um and they don&#39;t have the kind of
[00:27:58] training facilities and programs that we
[00:28:00] so richly have here to me India is the
[00:28:01] big swing state in that regard China&#39;s
[00:28:03] Lost it&#39;s not going to not going to come
[00:28:04] back they&#39;re not going to change the
[00:28:05] regime as much as people wish them to do
[00:28:07] Japan and Korea are clearly in our camp
[00:28:09] Taiwan is a fantastic country whose
[00:28:11] software is terrible so that&#39;s not gonna
[00:28:12] going to work um amazing hard and in the
[00:28:15] rest of the world there are not a lot of
[00:28:16] other good choices that are big German
[00:28:18] the Europe is screwed up because of
[00:28:19] Brussels it&#39;s not a new fact I spent 10
[00:28:20] years fighting them and I work really
[00:28:22] hard to get them to fix the the EU act
[00:28:24] and they still have all the restrictions
[00:28:26] that make it very difficult to do our
[00:28:27] kind of research in Europe my French
[00:28:28] friends have spent all their time
[00:28:29] battling Brussels and mcon who&#39;s a
[00:28:31] personal friend is fighting hard for
[00:28:33] this and so France I think has a chance
[00:28:34] I don&#39;t see I don&#39;t see Germany coming
[00:28:35] and the rest is not big
[00:28:36] enough yes ma&#39;am so I know you&#39;re an
[00:28:39] engineer by
[00:28:40] trainer um given the capabilities that
[00:28:43] you Enis these mod should we still spend
[00:28:44] Hing to yeah because because ultimately
[00:28:46] it&#39;s it&#39;s the old thing of why do you
[00:28:47] study English if you can speak English
[00:28:49] you get better at it right you really do
[00:28:50] need to understand how these systems
[00:28:51] work and I feel very strong yes sir yeah
[00:28:53] I&#39;m curious if you explore good answer
[00:28:55] distributed setting and I&#39;m asking
[00:28:56] because sure like making a large cluster
[00:28:58] but Ma are powerful there&#39;s a lot of
[00:28:59] small maches across the world so like
[00:29:01] you think like folding at home are a
[00:29:02] similar idea works for training yeah we
[00:29:04] look very hard this so the way the
[00:29:06] algorithms work is you have a very large
[00:29:07] Matrix and you have essentially a
[00:29:08] multiplication function so think of it
[00:29:10] as going back and forth and back and
[00:29:12] forth and these systems are completely
[00:29:13] limited by the speed of memory to CPU or
[00:29:15] GPU and in fact the next iteration of
[00:29:18] Nvidia chips has combined all those
[00:29:20] functions into one chip the chips are
[00:29:21] now so big that they glue them all
[00:29:22] together and in fact the package is so
[00:29:24] sensitive the package is put together in
[00:29:26] a clean room as well as the chip itself
[00:29:27] so the looks like supercomputers and
[00:29:29] speed of light especially memory
[00:29:31] interconnect really dominated so I think
[00:29:32] unlikely for a while is there a way to
[00:29:33] segment the element like so Jeff de last
[00:29:35] year when he spoke here talked about
[00:29:36] having these different parts of it you
[00:29:38] train separately and then kind of
[00:29:39] Federate them each you know in order to
[00:29:41] do that you&#39;d have to have 10 million
[00:29:42] such things and then you&#39;re the way you
[00:29:44] ask the questions would be too slow he&#39;s
[00:29:45] talking about eight or 10 12 not at Lev
[00:29:49] the back way back I know like after
[00:29:51] releas new yor time open using work for
[00:29:53] training do you think
[00:29:54] that&#39;s I used to do a lot of work on the
[00:29:56] music licensing stuff what I learned was
[00:29:58] that in the 60s there was a series of
[00:30:00] lawsuits that resulted in an agreement
[00:30:02] where you get a a stipulated royalty
[00:30:04] whenever your song is played even even
[00:30:06] they don&#39;t even know who you are so paid
[00:30:07] into a bank and my guess is it&#39;ll be the
[00:30:08] same thing there be lots of lawsuits and
[00:30:09] there&#39;ll be some kind of stipulated
[00:30:10] agreement which will just say you have
[00:30:12] to pay x per of whatever Revenue you
[00:30:14] have in order to use pass cap BMI cap
[00:30:16] BMI look them up it&#39;s long it will seem
[00:30:17] very old to you but I think that&#39;s how
[00:30:18] it will yes sir interesting like there&#39;s
[00:30:21] a few players that are dominating AI
[00:30:23] right they&#39;ll continue to dominate and
[00:30:24] they seem to overlap with the large
[00:30:25] companies that all the antitrust
[00:30:27] regulation is kind of focus on how do
[00:30:28] you see those two Trends kind of yeah
[00:30:30] like do you see Regulators breaking up
[00:30:31] these companies and how will that affect
[00:30:33] the yeah so in my career I helped
[00:30:36] Microsoft get broken up and it wasn&#39;t
[00:30:37] broken up and I fought fought for Google
[00:30:39] to not be broken up and it&#39;s not been
[00:30:40] broken up so it sure looks to me like
[00:30:41] the trend is not to be broken up um as
[00:30:43] long as the companies avoid being John D
[00:30:45] Rockefeller the senior and I studied
[00:30:46] this looked it up it&#39;s how antitrust law
[00:30:48] came I don&#39;t think the government is
[00:30:49] will act the re the reason you&#39;re seeing
[00:30:51] these large companies dominate is who
[00:30:52] has the capital to build these data
[00:30:54] centers right right so my friend Reed
[00:30:56] and my friend com
[00:30:58] two have we talked to you about the
[00:31:00] decision that they made to take
[00:31:01] inflection so I believe Mustafa he&#39;s
[00:31:02] talking about Mustafa siman who is the
[00:31:04] co-founder of Google Deep Mind friend
[00:31:06] Reed and my friend M coming next we two
[00:31:08] week have Reed talked to you about the
[00:31:10] decision that they made to take
[00:31:11] inflection and essentially PE part it
[00:31:12] into Microsoft basically they decided
[00:31:14] they couldn&#39;t raise the tens of billions
[00:31:15] of dollars is that number public that
[00:31:16] you mentioned earlier have
[00:31:18] have
[00:31:20] got we want
[00:31:24] this I was wondering where all this is
[00:31:26] going to leave countries where in b
[00:31:27] ipants in phun models and access to
[00:31:30] compu the rich get richer and the poor
[00:31:32] do the best they can um they&#39;ll have to
[00:31:34] the fact of the matter is this is a rich
[00:31:36] country&#39;s game right huge Capital lots
[00:31:38] of technically strong people strong
[00:31:39] government support right there are two
[00:31:41] examples there lots of other countries
[00:31:43] that have all sorts of problems they
[00:31:43] don&#39;t have those resources they&#39;ll have
[00:31:44] to find a partner they&#39;ll have to join
[00:31:46] with somebody else something like that I
[00:31:48] last we met you he&#39;s fairly blunt he&#39;s
[00:31:50] fairly straightforward he I think kind
[00:31:52] of calls it how he sees it and it really
[00:31:55] seems like he&#39;s not talking one side or
[00:31:56] the other he doesn&#39;t have he&#39;s not
[00:31:58] pumping his back so to speak so he&#39;s not
[00:32:00] saying the things that benefit his
[00:32:01] portfolio or whatever he&#39;s just like
[00:32:03] yeah this is how it&#39;s going to be this
[00:32:04] is how it works by default big companies
[00:32:06] are not going to broken up the rich get
[00:32:07] richer Etc and finally he&#39;s asked a
[00:32:10] little bit more about kind of the
[00:32:11] business and entrepreneur side of things
[00:32:13] if you&#39;re starting your own company you
[00:32:15] have a product idea what does that look
[00:32:16] like how do you develop it how do you
[00:32:18] create a lot of wealth with your own
[00:32:20] product here&#39;s his answer I want I think
[00:32:23] the last we met you you at hackathon at
[00:32:24] AGI house and I know you spent a lot of
[00:32:26] time helping like young people as they
[00:32:27] create a lot of wealth and you spoke
[00:32:28] very passionately about about wanting to
[00:32:30] to do that do you have any advice for
[00:32:31] folks here as they&#39;re building their
[00:32:32] they&#39;re writing their business PL for
[00:32:33] this class or policy proposals or
[00:32:34] research proposals um you know at this
[00:32:36] stage of the careers going forward well
[00:32:39] um I teach a class in the business
[00:32:40] school on this so you should come to my
[00:32:41] class um the I am struck by the speed
[00:32:44] which with which you can build
[00:32:46] demonstrations of new ideas so in that
[00:32:49] in one of the hack I did the winning
[00:32:51] team the command was fly the Drone
[00:32:53] between two towers and it was given a
[00:32:54] virtual drone space and it figured out
[00:32:56] how to fly the Drone what the word
[00:32:57] between them generated the code in
[00:32:58] Python and flew the Drone in the
[00:32:59] simulator through the tower I just it
[00:33:01] would have taken a week or two you know
[00:33:03] good professional programmers to do that
[00:33:05] um I&#39;m telling you that the ability to
[00:33:06] prototype quickly really you know part
[00:33:08] part of the problem being an
[00:33:09] entrepreneur is everything happens
[00:33:10] faster well now if you can&#39;t get your
[00:33:12] prototype built in a day using these
[00:33:14] various tools you need to think about
[00:33:16] that right because that&#39;s who your
[00:33:17] competitor is doing so I guess my
[00:33:18] biggest advice is when you start
[00:33:19] thinking about a company is find the
[00:33:20] right a business CL plan in fact you
[00:33:22] should ask the computer to write your
[00:33:23] business plan for you
[00:33:25] um talk about that after leave it and
[00:33:28] and but I think it&#39;s very important to
[00:33:30] prototype your idea using these tools as
[00:33:32] quickly as you can because you can be
[00:33:33] sure there&#39;s another person doing
[00:33:34] exactly that same thing in another
[00:33:36] company in another University in a place
[00:33:38] that You&#39; all right
[00:33:40] thank very cool so this piece was uh
[00:33:43] taken down so apparently it&#39;s not even
[00:33:44] online right now but hopefully those few
[00:33:47] little Clips give you glips about what
[00:33:49] he thinks of AI you know I&#39;ve kind of
[00:33:51] cut out all the pieces that I think
[00:33:53] caused the controversy or whatever that
[00:33:55] situation was I don&#39;t think it really
[00:33:56] had anything to do with AI or anything
[00:33:58] of of substance I mean maybe touched on
[00:34:01] some political issues but whatever this
[00:34:03] is a person with a lot of really
[00:34:05] technical background and even though
[00:34:07] he&#39;s more of like a business guy he is
[00:34:10] spoken of with a lot of respect by all
[00:34:12] the engineers and all the very highly
[00:34:14] technical people in the Bay Area in the
[00:34:16] Silicon Valley he&#39;s somebody that really
[00:34:17] understands the tech space looks like
[00:34:19] Forbes has him listed as having a netw
[00:34:21] worth of almost $24 billion he&#39;s good
[00:34:25] friends he said with Sam Alman president
[00:34:27] of France France sounds like he knows
[00:34:29] all the co-founders of various AI
[00:34:31] companies big and small I mean this is
[00:34:33] somebody that&#39;s very very on the inside
[00:34:35] this is somebody that knows where things
[00:34:37] are going so certainly when he says
[00:34:39] something I tend to listen I put a great
[00:34:41] deal of weight into what he&#39;s saying and
[00:34:43] what he&#39;s saying is this AI wave is just
[00:34:47] starting we have two massive countries
[00:34:49] two big countries with the capital and
[00:34:50] the talent and everything else that&#39;s
[00:34:52] needed that are vying for AI Supremacy
[00:34:54] the issues with the chips and the power
[00:34:56] and the data while those are bottlenecks
[00:34:59] it seems like they will slowly be
[00:35:01] perhaps even maybe not that slowly
[00:35:03] slowly but but be improved you mentioned
[00:35:05] building data centers and various other
[00:35:07] AI infrastructure in Canada potentially
[00:35:10] which makes a lot of sense if you think
[00:35:12] about it lots of open land tends to be
[00:35:14] colder which again you know Heating and
[00:35:17] the generation of heat and having to
[00:35:19] cool these facilities is a concern tons
[00:35:22] land very friendly government to the US
[00:35:24] you know in factorio how do you just
[00:35:26] like find a big chunk of the map where
[00:35:28] there&#39;s a lot of open land and you&#39;d
[00:35:30] build all your nuclear power plants
[00:35:32] you&#39;d build out your entire like
[00:35:34] electricity infrastructure there just
[00:35:36] have a cable going back to where you
[00:35:38] need electricity to be it begs the
[00:35:40] question is this the future of Canada
[00:35:42] I&#39;m only kidding of course folks but the
[00:35:45] more and more I think about it there is
[00:35:46] a lot of land it&#39;s close by and it&#39;s
[00:35:49] cold and certainly that would be
[00:35:51] phenomenal for the revenue of Canada to
[00:35:53] generate some sort of tax some sort of
[00:35:55] Revenue based on right one of the kind
[00:35:57] of superpowers building out the
[00:35:59] infrastructure it needs to stay dominant
[00:36:01] in the AI race right I mean they&#39;re
[00:36:03] talking about creating 100 billion doll
[00:36:06] data centers potentially even the
[00:36:08] estimates a size 300 billion so that&#39;s
[00:36:10] that&#39;s one company that&#39;s not even the
[00:36:12] US government supported projects that&#39;s
[00:36:15] just a publicly traded company doing
[00:36:17] that sounds like he&#39;s really believing
[00:36:19] in Nvidia and the power of Nvidia and
[00:36:21] it&#39;s Cuda sort of software that the
[00:36:24] chips run on and if I&#39;m understanding
[00:36:26] him correctly he&#39;s not really seeing any
[00:36:28] competition to that I mean there&#39;s some
[00:36:30] things in the Horizon maybe possibly but
[00:36:32] nothing yet so it sounds like a lot of
[00:36:35] this money like a lot of it will be
[00:36:36] flowing into Nvidia and of course this
[00:36:39] idea that as the context window expands
[00:36:41] it&#39;ll become more and more sort of
[00:36:44] similar to training in a sense that
[00:36:46] right if it takes a while to train up a
[00:36:47] model but it can do in context learning
[00:36:50] meaning that you&#39;re able to just upload
[00:36:51] books and stuff to the finished model
[00:36:53] it&#39;s able to learn from them which we&#39;ve
[00:36:54] seen that with Gemini they found a
[00:36:56] language that doesn&#39;t have an a lot of
[00:36:57] online presence only something like 24
[00:37:00] people in the world speak it but they
[00:37:01] have some notebooks and manuscripts and
[00:37:03] stuff like that they uploaded to gini
[00:37:05] the actual finished trained Gemini and
[00:37:08] that model was able to learn how to
[00:37:11] speak it how to create sentences in it
[00:37:13] it wasn&#39;t trained on it it would learned
[00:37:15] in context right so as the context
[00:37:18] window ramps up to 10 million tokens
[00:37:21] that certainly seems like it would
[00:37:22] change how we think about pre- and
[00:37:25] posttraining or in other words once the
[00:37:27] model is trained it doesn&#39;t stop
[00:37:29] learning if you wanted to learn about a
[00:37:31] specific thing that you wanted to learn
[00:37:33] about maybe it&#39;s you know you have a
[00:37:34] company or that that have millions of
[00:37:37] documents and procedures and stuff like
[00:37:39] that just kind of like everywhere but no
[00:37:41] one person understands all of it well in
[00:37:43] the past that was kind of useless it
[00:37:45] doesn&#39;t really help you but if you can
[00:37:47] upload it to a model like that all of a
[00:37:49] sudden it knows all those things about
[00:37:51] your company it can train people on it
[00:37:54] it can answer your questions it can kind
[00:37:55] of manage it update see if there&#39;s any
[00:37:58] conflicts anywhere in it so instead of
[00:38:00] training a brand new model on that you
[00:38:02] just use an existing model and upload
[00:38:04] that stuff into the 10 million token
[00:38:07] context window combine that with text to
[00:38:09] action which is another word I&#39;ve heard
[00:38:11] it before this phrase but it&#39;s not that
[00:38:14] often used I feel like but yeah I mean
[00:38:16] that&#39;s what agents are basically right
[00:38:18] it&#39;s text to action you type in impr
[00:38:21] prompt and it goes and does that action
[00:38:23] it does the thing you&#39;re asking it to do
[00:38:25] as they get better at long-term plan
[00:38:27] long-term reasoning and actually Deep
[00:38:29] Mind CEO de saabi is also just had an
[00:38:32] interview talking about something very
[00:38:34] very similar he&#39;s talking about this
[00:38:36] idea that as agents become better
[00:38:38] long-term reasoners and planners they
[00:38:40] will become better and better at
[00:38:42] carrying out those long Horizon tasks
[00:38:44] and he&#39;s saying we&#39;re not ready for it
[00:38:46] when everybody can have these qualified
[00:38:49] capable agents right he&#39;s saying it&#39;s
[00:38:51] going to have an impact on the world at
[00:38:53] a scale no one understands yet and that
[00:38:56] certainly I think is true that&#39;s
[00:38:58] certainly something that I fully agree
[00:39:00] with a lot of our social structures and
[00:39:03] stuff we&#39;re kind of used to will have to
[00:39:05] change and of course he&#39;s saying if
[00:39:06] you&#39;re worried about losing your job
[00:39:08] having a degree that&#39;s going to become
[00:39:09] worthless you know should you still
[00:39:11] learn to code he&#39;s saying business as
[00:39:13] usual there yes some easy simple jobs or
[00:39:16] maybe very dangerous jobs jobs where
[00:39:18] there&#39;s not a lot of hard decisions to
[00:39:20] be made yes those might go away and yes
[00:39:23] these AIS might be pretty good at coding
[00:39:25] creating projects but learning all those
[00:39:27] skills getting better at those skills
[00:39:28] learning how everything works that&#39;s
[00:39:30] that&#39;s not going out of fashion that&#39;s
[00:39:32] never going to just disappear his
[00:39:34] example was you know if you can speak
[00:39:36] English why would you learn English
[00:39:38] right why would you study English well
[00:39:40] it&#39;s to get better at it to improve your
[00:39:42] abilities with it so I hope you enjoyed
[00:39:44] that make sure you subscribed please
[00:39:46] give me a thumbs up if you enjoyed it my
[00:39:48] name is Wes rth and I&#39;ll see you next
[00:39:49] time thank you for watching
[00:00:00] Eric Schmidt gave a facety talk at
[00:00:02] Stanford just a few days ago about AI he
[00:00:05] was of course the former Google CEO and
[00:00:08] perceived by people as a bit of a
[00:00:10] futurist he&#39;s able to kind of often very
[00:00:12] accurately predict where technology is
[00:00:14] going the interview was over an hour
[00:00:16] long and it was fascinating covering
[00:00:18] topics like ai ai agents where this
[00:00:20] whole thing is going Etc and had a lot
[00:00:22] of pretty brilliant insights by Eric
[00:00:25] into where he believes this is going but
[00:00:28] unfortunately at our plus long interview
[00:00:30] there was just one comment that people
[00:00:32] didn&#39;t like the media machine went into
[00:00:35] overdrive mode and the video has been
[00:00:38] basically taken down it&#39;s no longer
[00:00:40] available to see it was deemed too hot
[00:00:43] for the internet and no longer available
[00:00:45] but just between you and me and keep
[00:00:48] this on the DL please I might have a
[00:00:51] copy of it maybe allegedly I feel like I
[00:00:54] need to say something here that reduces
[00:00:55] my liability some sort of a legal
[00:00:58] statement like I take no resp
[00:00:59] responsibility for my actions yeah that
[00:01:01] should do subscribe for more sweet AI
[00:01:03] content let&#39;s take a look at a few clips
[00:01:05] from this Stanford lecture by Eric
[00:01:08] Schmidt about AI I think you will like
[00:01:10] it if you do hit that thumbs up please
[00:01:13] because this is somebody that has a bit
[00:01:14] of a Clairvoyance about the future of
[00:01:16] tech he tends to see how things will
[00:01:18] unfold with startling accuracy so before
[00:01:21] he starts talking he asks the class to
[00:01:23] basically Define what a context window
[00:01:25] is and what AI agents are context
[00:01:28] Windows of course you can think of it as
[00:01:29] sort of a short-term memory it&#39;s
[00:01:31] basically the amount of words that a
[00:01:33] large language model can read and also
[00:01:36] write and output and kind of interact
[00:01:38] with right so if it has a large context
[00:01:40] window you can give it a whole book and
[00:01:42] then ask it questions about the book if
[00:01:44] it has a very short context window we
[00:01:46] might start answering a question and
[00:01:47] then halfway through forget what I was
[00:01:49] talking about it would be kind of a
[00:01:50] whoops I run out of memory type of thing
[00:01:52] and AI agents are things they can sort
[00:01:55] of complete tasks on your behalf you can
[00:01:56] tell them to go order something off of
[00:01:58] Amazon they&#39;ll go they&#39;ll search they&#39;ll
[00:02:00] do reviews they&#39;ll check the sizes the
[00:02:02] colors whatever and then order it and
[00:02:04] then report that they&#39;ve done it back to
[00:02:05] you so you can think of it as kind of a
[00:02:07] smart intern that&#39;s online that&#39;s Ai and
[00:02:10] Eric is talking about potentially a
[00:02:11] seeing a 10 million token context window
[00:02:15] sometime soon potentially in next two
[00:02:17] years or so he doesn&#39;t specify a
[00:02:19] timeline but soon so the first thing he
[00:02:21] talks about is what are we going to
[00:02:23] expect to happen in the next 2 to 5
[00:02:26] years so in the short term specifically
[00:02:29] at the intersection of something like a
[00:02:31] 10 million token context window and
[00:02:33] improving autonomous AI agents take a
[00:02:35] listen so an agent is something that
[00:02:37] does that does some kind of a task
[00:02:39] another definition would be that it&#39;s an
[00:02:40] LM State and memory okay can anybody
[00:02:44] again scientist can can any of you
[00:02:45] define text action taking text and
[00:02:47] turning into an action right here go
[00:02:48] ahead yes instead of taking text and
[00:02:50] turning it into more text more text
[00:02:52] taking text and have the AI trigger
[00:02:54] actions based so another definition
[00:02:56] would be language to python a pro
[00:02:59] programming language I never wanted to
[00:03:00] see survive and and everything in AI is
[00:03:02] being done in Python there&#39;s a new
[00:03:03] language called Mojo that has just come
[00:03:05] out which looks like they finally have
[00:03:06] addressed AI programming but we&#39;ll see
[00:03:07] if that actually survives over the
[00:03:08] dominance of python um one more
[00:03:10] technical question why is NVIDIA worth2
[00:03:12] trillion doll and the other companies
[00:03:14] are struggling technical answer I mean I
[00:03:16] think it just boils down to like most of
[00:03:17] code needs to run with C optimizations
[00:03:19] that currently only support so other
[00:03:21] companies can make whatever they want to
[00:03:22] but unless they have the 10 years of
[00:03:24] software there you don&#39;t have the
[00:03:25] machine learning optimization I like to
[00:03:27] think of Cuda as the C programming
[00:03:29] language for
[00:03:30] yeah right that&#39;s the way I like to
[00:03:31] think of it was founded in 2008 I always
[00:03:32] thought it was a terrible language and
[00:03:34] yet it&#39;s become dominant there&#39;s another
[00:03:35] Insight there&#39;s a set of Open Source
[00:03:36] libraries which are highly optimized to
[00:03:38] Cuda and not anything else and everybody
[00:03:39] who builds all these Stacks right this
[00:03:41] is completely missed in any of the
[00:03:42] discussions right the com it&#39;s
[00:03:44] technically called VM and a whole bunch
[00:03:45] of libraries like that highly optimized
[00:03:47] Cuda very hard to replicate that if
[00:03:48] you&#39;re a competitor so what does all
[00:03:50] this mean in the next year you&#39;re going
[00:03:52] to see very large context Windows agents
[00:03:56] and text action when they are delivered
[00:03:58] at scale it&#39;s going to have an impact on
[00:03:59] world at a scale that no one understands
[00:04:01] yet much bigger than the horrific impact
[00:04:03] we&#39;ve had on by social media right in my
[00:04:05] view so here&#39;s why in a context window
[00:04:07] you can basically use that as short-term
[00:04:08] memory and I was shocked that context
[00:04:11] Windows get this long the technical
[00:04:12] reasons have to do with the fact that
[00:04:13] it&#39;s hard to serve hard to calculate and
[00:04:14] so forth the interesting thing about
[00:04:15] short-term memory when you feed the you
[00:04:18] ask a question read 20 books you give it
[00:04:20] the text of the books is the query and
[00:04:22] you say tell me what they say it forgets
[00:04:23] the middle which is exactly how human
[00:04:25] brains work too right that&#39;s where we
[00:04:26] are with respect to agents there are
[00:04:28] people who are now building essentially
[00:04:30] llm agents and the way they do it is
[00:04:31] they read something like chemistry they
[00:04:33] discover the principles of chemistry and
[00:04:34] then they test it and then they add that
[00:04:36] back into their understanding right
[00:04:38] that&#39;s extremely powerful and then the
[00:04:40] third thing as I mentioned is text
[00:04:41] action so I&#39;ll give you an example the
[00:04:43] government is in the process of trying
[00:04:45] to ban Tik to we&#39;ll see if that actually
[00:04:46] happens if Tik Tok is banned here&#39;s what
[00:04:48] I propose each and every one of you do
[00:04:49] say to your L the foll make me a copy of
[00:04:53] Tik Tok steal all the users steal all
[00:04:55] the music put my preferences in it
[00:04:57] produce this program in the next 30
[00:04:59] seconds release it and in one hour if
[00:05:01] it&#39;s not viral do something different
[00:05:03] along the same lines that&#39;s the command
[00:05:05] boom boom boom boom right you understand
[00:05:08] how powerful that is if you could go
[00:05:09] from arbitrary language to arbitrary
[00:05:11] digital command which is essentially
[00:05:12] what python in this scenario is imagine
[00:05:14] that each and every human on the planet
[00:05:16] has their own programmer that actually
[00:05:18] does what they want as opposed to the
[00:05:18] programmers that work for me who don&#39;t
[00:05:20] do what I ask or potentially a whole
[00:05:22] Army of AI influencers each with its own
[00:05:25] little tweak that are completely managed
[00:05:28] by these AI agents trying to fill a
[00:05:30] certain Niche a certain Gap a certain
[00:05:32] personality type you can have an
[00:05:34] infinite amount of them boasting 24
[00:05:36] hours a day the programmers here know
[00:05:38] what I&#39;m talking about so imagine a non-
[00:05:39] arrogant programmer that actually does
[00:05:41] what you want and you don&#39;t have to pay
[00:05:42] all that money to and there&#39;s infinite
[00:05:44] supply of these program this is all
[00:05:45] within the next year or two very soon
[00:05:47] those three things and I&#39;m quite
[00:05:49] convinced it&#39;s the union of those three
[00:05:50] things that will happen in the next wave
[00:05:53] so you asked about what else is going to
[00:05:54] happen um every six months I oscillate
[00:05:57] so we&#39;re on a it&#39;s an even odd
[00:05:58] oscillation the moment the gap between
[00:06:01] the frontier models which they&#39;re now
[00:06:02] only three I&#39;ll ref few who they are and
[00:06:05] everybody else appears to me to be
[00:06:06] getting larger six months ago I was
[00:06:08] convinced that the Gap was getting
[00:06:09] smaller so I invested lots of money in
[00:06:10] the little companies now I&#39;m not so sure
[00:06:13] and I&#39;m talking to the big companies and
[00:06:14] the big companies are telling me that
[00:06:15] they need 10 billion 20 billion 50
[00:06:18] billion 100 billion is 100 billion right
[00:06:21] they very very hard I talked Sam
[00:06:23] Stargate is Microsoft and open AI sort
[00:06:26] of co- project where they plan to invest
[00:06:28] a 100 billion into a Data Center and by
[00:06:31] the way that&#39;s not the only project
[00:06:33] where they&#39;re kind of working together
[00:06:34] the other one is the power plant the
[00:06:37] fusion power plant somewhere near
[00:06:39] Seattle Washington in that area that
[00:06:42] they hope could potentially provide a
[00:06:43] lot of you know maybe not unlimited
[00:06:45] energy but clean cheap inexpensive
[00:06:48] energy to power a lot of the stuff next
[00:06:50] he&#39;s talking about what he and Sam Alpin
[00:06:52] talked about Sam Alman is a close friend
[00:06:54] he believes it&#39;s going to take about 300
[00:06:56] billion maybe more I pointed out to him
[00:06:58] that I done the calculation on the
[00:06:59] amount of energy required and I and I
[00:07:02] then in the spirit of full disclosure
[00:07:03] went to the White House on Friday and
[00:07:04] told them that we need to become best
[00:07:06] friends with Canada because Canada has
[00:07:08] really nice people helped invent Ai and
[00:07:10] lots of hydrop power because we as a
[00:07:12] country do not have enough power to do
[00:07:13] this keep in mind too that there&#39;s a lot
[00:07:15] of sort of heat generated in these
[00:07:17] processes so the need to cool these
[00:07:20] buildings these infrastructures you know
[00:07:23] if you&#39;re running it somewhere where
[00:07:24] it&#39;s hot you also have to consider your
[00:07:26] AC Bill running it somewhere where it&#39;s
[00:07:28] naturally cold old could be very you
[00:07:31] know profitable you would greatly slash
[00:07:33] your costs because you don&#39;t have to
[00:07:34] worry about cooling or at least not as
[00:07:37] much the alternative is to have the
[00:07:39] Arabs fund it and I like the Arabs
[00:07:40] personally I spent lots of time there
[00:07:42] right but they&#39;re not going to adhere to
[00:07:43] our national security rules whereas
[00:07:44] Canada and the US are part of a trit
[00:07:46] where that we all so the1 billion $300
[00:07:48] billion data centers electricity starts
[00:07:49] becoming the scarce resource well but
[00:07:51] and by the way if you follow this line
[00:07:52] of reasoning why did I discuss Cuda and
[00:07:54] Nvidia if $300 billion is all going to
[00:07:56] go to Nvidia you know what to do in the
[00:07:57] stock market okay that&#39;s sounds like
[00:07:59] he&#39;s recommending people buy Nvidia not
[00:08:01] a stock recommendation I&#39;m not a
[00:08:03] licens well part of it so we&#39;re need a
[00:08:05] lot more chips but Intel is getting a
[00:08:07] lot of money from the US government
[00:08:08] AMD they&#39;re trying to build you know
[00:08:10] Fabs raise your hand if you have an
[00:08:12] Intel computer in your Intel chip in any
[00:08:14] of your Computing
[00:08:15] devices okay so much for the Monopoly
[00:08:19] well that that&#39;s that&#39;s the point though
[00:08:20] they once did have a monopoly absolutely
[00:08:21] and Nvidia has a monopoly now so are
[00:08:22] those barriers T like like Cuda is that
[00:08:24] is there something that other so I was
[00:08:26] talking to Percy Percy land the other
[00:08:27] day he&#39;s switching between tpus and
[00:08:29] Nvidia depending on what you can get
[00:08:30] access so for those who are not aware
[00:08:32] one big race that&#39;s happening right now
[00:08:34] is kind of the race to produce these
[00:08:37] chips that power AI growth and Nvidia
[00:08:40] has been kind of the I mean you can say
[00:08:41] the Undisputed leader in the field
[00:08:43] producing gpus graphical processing
[00:08:46] units and those have been very effective
[00:08:48] they kind of started with you know
[00:08:50] computer games acceleration because
[00:08:51] instead of running each process kind of
[00:08:53] independently finishing and running the
[00:08:55] next one which could create bottlenecks
[00:08:57] it runs them in parallel so for example
[00:08:59] if you&#39;re rendering and gain them on
[00:09:00] screen right you have some some crazy 3D
[00:09:03] game with solar rays and whatever that&#39;s
[00:09:05] running in you know 30 frames per second
[00:09:07] 60 frames per second you know what I
[00:09:08] mean you need to be able to Rend each
[00:09:10] pixel on the screen in real time you
[00:09:12] can&#39;t wait for it to get rendered you
[00:09:14] have to kind of render it all in
[00:09:16] parallel and gpus were really good at
[00:09:18] that that&#39;s part of the power of why
[00:09:20] Nvidia is so powerful as well as Cuda
[00:09:22] the programming language that they run
[00:09:24] on but we do have other alternatives for
[00:09:26] these AI chips the TPU the tensor
[00:09:29] processing unit is Google&#39;s creation
[00:09:31] recently we&#39;ve also seen Gro which is a
[00:09:34] something that they refer to as a
[00:09:35] language processing unit and lpu there&#39;s
[00:09:38] been some talk of neuromorphic chips
[00:09:41] which are more designed like the human
[00:09:42] brain they&#39;re not digital they&#39;re more
[00:09:44] analog but I don&#39;t know if any progress
[00:09:46] has been made in that field and it
[00:09:48] sounds like Sam Alman is cooking up a
[00:09:51] brand new chip that might eventually go
[00:09:53] on to compete with Nvidia that&#39;s still
[00:09:55] in the very early stages but that&#39;s the
[00:09:57] big question is NVIDIA continue to
[00:10:00] dominate or is somebody going to come
[00:10:01] out with something that&#39;s brand new and
[00:10:03] much much better for AI specifically cuz
[00:10:06] gpus aren&#39;t necessarily the best
[00:10:10] possible sort of architecture for AI
[00:10:14] they happen to be very good they happen
[00:10:15] to be the best thing we have right now
[00:10:17] but nothing&#39;s to say that some different
[00:10:19] architecture can&#39;t be a million times
[00:10:22] better just because it&#39;s built from
[00:10:23] scratch for AI inference and training
[00:10:26] absolutely and Nvidia has a monopoly now
[00:10:28] so are those barriers like like Cuda is
[00:10:30] that is there something that other so I
[00:10:32] was talking to Percy Percy the other day
[00:10:33] he&#39;s switching between tpus and Nvidia
[00:10:35] chips depending on what he can get
[00:10:36] access to because he doesn&#39;t have a
[00:10:38] choice if he had infinite money he would
[00:10:39] today he would pick the b200
[00:10:41] architecture out of Nvidia because it
[00:10:42] would be faster and I&#39;m not suggest I
[00:10:44] mean it&#39;s great to have competition i&#39;
[00:10:45] AMD and Lisa Su at create length they
[00:10:47] have built a a thing which will
[00:10:48] translate from um this Cuda architecture
[00:10:50] that you were describing to their own
[00:10:52] which is called rock it doesn&#39;t quite
[00:10:53] work yet they&#39;re working on it so Lisa
[00:10:55] Sue that&#39;s of AMD so one of the Nidia
[00:10:59] competitors AMD and Lisa Su great length
[00:11:01] they have built a a thing which will
[00:11:03] translate from um this Cuda architecture
[00:11:05] that you were describing to their own
[00:11:06] which is called roam it doesn&#39;t quite
[00:11:07] work yet that get transcribed as cud
[00:11:10] architecture but that&#39;s not what it is
[00:11:12] he&#39;s saying Cuda architecture cud da so
[00:11:14] the Nidia sort of architecture versus
[00:11:16] Rockham I&#39;m not familiar with that one I
[00:11:18] guess that&#39;s amd&#39;s version of Cuda U you
[00:11:21] were at Google for a long time and uh
[00:11:23] they invented the Transformer
[00:11:24] architecture it&#39;s all Peter&#39;s fault
[00:11:26] thanks to uh to brilliant people over
[00:11:27] there like Peter and Jeff and everyone
[00:11:29] um but now it doesn&#39;t seem like they&#39;re
[00:11:32] they kind of lost ini so I guess this is
[00:11:34] the part that caused all the hubub I&#39;m
[00:11:35] just skipping it I&#39;m not touching it
[00:11:37] it&#39;s not really related to AI
[00:11:39] necessarily unfortunately I think
[00:11:41] there&#39;s a lot of overlap with politics
[00:11:42] so I&#39;m just trying to avoid that but it
[00:11:44] seems like he&#39;s saying that it might be
[00:11:45] like a cultural issue but let&#39;s continue
[00:11:48] and see what else they&#39;ve talked about
[00:11:50] yes sir in terms of national security or
[00:11:52] interest have play a role or competition
[00:11:54] with China as well so I was the chairman
[00:11:56] of an AI commission that sort of looked
[00:11:57] at this very carefully and um you can
[00:11:59] read it it&#39;s about 752 pages and I&#39;ll
[00:12:01] just summarize it by saying we&#39;re ahead
[00:12:03] we need to stay ahead and we need lots
[00:12:04] of money to do so our customers were the
[00:12:05] senate in the house um and out of that
[00:12:08] came the chips act and a lot of other
[00:12:09] stuff like that um a rough scenario is
[00:12:12] that the chips act invested billions
[00:12:14] into building out the US infrastructure
[00:12:16] to develop AI chips and also I believe
[00:12:18] that&#39;s what limited a lot of the
[00:12:20] nvidia&#39;s export to China some of the
[00:12:23] best chips the most powerful chips it
[00:12:24] limited the exports to China how much
[00:12:27] they could ship and sell in China how it
[00:12:29] seems like that&#39;s creating a bit of a
[00:12:31] black market of people trying to import
[00:12:33] those into China through other means but
[00:12:36] if you assume the frontier models drive
[00:12:37] forward and a few of the open source
[00:12:39] models it&#39;s likely that a very small
[00:12:40] number of companies can play this game
[00:12:42] countries excuse me what are those
[00:12:43] countries or who are they countries with
[00:12:45] a lot of money and a lot of talent
[00:12:46] strong Educational Systems and a
[00:12:47] willingness to win the US is one of them
[00:12:49] China is another one how many others are
[00:12:51] there are there any
[00:12:52] others I don&#39;t know maybe but certainly
[00:12:55] the in your lifetimes the battle between
[00:12:57] the US and China for knowledge Supremacy
[00:12:59] is going to be the big fight right so
[00:13:01] the US government banned essentially the
[00:13:02] Invidia chips although they weren&#39;t
[00:13:03] allowed to say that was what they were
[00:13:04] doing but they actually did that into
[00:13:05] China um they have about a 10year chip
[00:13:08] advant we have a roughly 10e chip
[00:13:09] advantage in terms of subdv is sub five
[00:13:12] roughly 10 years wow um and so you&#39;re
[00:13:14] gonna have so an example would be today
[00:13:16] we&#39;re a couple of years ahead of China
[00:13:17] my guess is we&#39;ll get a few more years
[00:13:18] ahead of China and the Chinese are
[00:13:20] whopping mad about this it&#39;s like hugely
[00:13:21] upset about it so that&#39;s a big deal that
[00:13:23] was a decision made by the Trump
[00:13:24] Administration and furthered by the
[00:13:25] Biden Administration do you think that
[00:13:27] it&#39;s going to make that scale of
[00:13:28] investment I mean OB the chips act but
[00:13:29] beyond that build building a massive AI
[00:13:32] system so so as you know I I lead a an
[00:13:34] informal ad hoc non-legal group that&#39;s
[00:13:37] that&#39;s different from illegal exactly
[00:13:39] justar which includes all the usual
[00:13:41] which includes all The Usual Suspects
[00:13:43] yes and The Usual Suspects over the last
[00:13:44] year came up with basis of the reasoning
[00:13:46] that became the um uh uh the B
[00:13:49] administration&#39;s uh AI act which is the
[00:13:51] longest Presidential Directive in
[00:13:53] history you&#39;re talking the special
[00:13:53] competitive studies Pro no this is the
[00:13:55] actual the actual act from the executive
[00:13:58] office and there implementing the
[00:13:59] details so far they&#39;ve got it right and
[00:14:01] so for example one of the debates that
[00:14:02] we had for last year has been how do you
[00:14:05] detect danger in a system which has
[00:14:07] learned it but you don&#39;t know what to
[00:14:09] ask it okay so in other words it&#39;s a
[00:14:11] core it&#39;s a sort of a core problem it&#39;s
[00:14:12] learned something bad but it can&#39;t tell
[00:14:14] you what it learned and you don&#39;t know
[00:14:15] what to ask it and there&#39;s so many
[00:14:16] threats right like it learned how to mix
[00:14:18] chemistry in some new way but you don&#39;t
[00:14:19] know how to ask it and so people are
[00:14:21] working hard on that but we ultimately
[00:14:22] wrote in our memos to them that there
[00:14:24] was a threshold which we arbitrarily
[00:14:25] named as 10 to the 26 flops which
[00:14:27] technically is a measure of computation
[00:14:29] that that threshold you had to report to
[00:14:31] the government that you were doing this
[00:14:32] and that&#39;s part of the rule the EU to
[00:14:35] just make sure they were different did
[00:14:36] 10 to 25 yeah but it&#39;s all kind of close
[00:14:38] enough I think all of these distinctions
[00:14:39] go away because the technology will now
[00:14:41] the technical term is called Federated
[00:14:42] training where basically you can take
[00:14:43] pieces and Union them together so we may
[00:14:46] not be able to keep keep people safe
[00:14:48] from these new things well rumors are
[00:14:49] that that&#39;s how open ey has had to train
[00:14:50] partly because of the power uh
[00:14:51] consumption there&#39;s no one place where
[00:14:53] so this is interesting I haven&#39;t heard
[00:14:55] that specific terminology before so he&#39;s
[00:14:57] saying that you can kind of build
[00:14:58] different pie pieces of LMS or sort of
[00:15:00] AI systems you train those pieces
[00:15:02] separately and then you Union them
[00:15:05] together you glue them together we&#39;ve
[00:15:06] seen this with the recent paper
[00:15:08] published where you can take sort of the
[00:15:09] large smart model and a very like a
[00:15:11] cheaper faster model and have sort of
[00:15:14] another sort of gatekeeper another yet
[00:15:16] another a model that kind of chooses
[00:15:17] where it routes the questions to so
[00:15:20] certain questions need to be answered by
[00:15:21] the bigger model but there&#39;s a lot that
[00:15:23] can be answered just as effectively by
[00:15:26] the smaller model and so this model just
[00:15:27] routes them to the cheaper model when
[00:15:29] needed and the results have been
[00:15:31] astonishing because it&#39;s if I remember
[00:15:33] my numbers correctly it has shown in
[00:15:35] some cases to reduce the cost of running
[00:15:37] these things by 80% while maintaining
[00:15:40] something like 96% accuracy so for just
[00:15:43] and I don&#39;t recall those the exact
[00:15:45] numbers but it was some big big numbers
[00:15:46] like that so it&#39;s a tiny reduction in
[00:15:48] accuracy for a potentially massive
[00:15:51] reduction in cost so I&#39;m not sure if
[00:15:53] that&#39;s an example of specifically what
[00:15:55] he&#39;s talking about but this idea of
[00:15:56] Federated training sounds like it&#39;s
[00:15:58] training piece in individual sort of
[00:16:00] batches right and taking those pieces
[00:16:02] and then putting them together to create
[00:16:04] the final model next they&#39;re talking
[00:16:06] about war well let&#39;s talk to about a
[00:16:08] real war that&#39;s going on I know that uh
[00:16:10] something you&#39;ve been very involved in
[00:16:11] is uh the Ukraine war and in particular
[00:16:15] uh I know that uh something you&#39;ve been
[00:16:17] very involved in is uh the Ukraine war
[00:16:19] and in particular uh I how you talk
[00:16:21] about white stor and your your goal of
[00:16:23] having a 500,000 $500 drones destroy $5
[00:16:26] million tanks so Howes that changing
[00:16:28] Warfare I work for the Secretary of
[00:16:29] Defense for seven years and and tried to
[00:16:32] change the way we run our military I&#39;m
[00:16:34] I&#39;m not a particularly big fan of the
[00:16:35] military but it&#39;s very expensive and I
[00:16:36] wanted to see if I could be helpful and
[00:16:37] I think in my view I largely failed they
[00:16:38] gave me a medal so they must give medals
[00:16:41] to failure or you know whatever but my
[00:16:43] self-criticism was nothing has really
[00:16:44] changed and the system in America is not
[00:16:47] going to lead to real Innovation so
[00:16:49] watching the Russians use tanks to
[00:16:51] destroy apartment buildings with little
[00:16:52] old ladies and kids just drove me crazy
[00:16:54] so I decided to work on a company with
[00:16:55] your friend Sebastian thrun and as a
[00:16:57] former faculty member here and a bunch
[00:16:59] of Stanford people and the idea
[00:17:01] basically is to do two things use AI in
[00:17:03] complicated powerful ways for these
[00:17:04] essentially robotic War and the second
[00:17:06] one is to lower the cost of the robots
[00:17:07] now you sit there and you go why would a
[00:17:09] good liberal like me do that and the
[00:17:10] answer is that the whole theory of
[00:17:13] armies is tanks artilleries and Mort and
[00:17:15] we can eliminate all of them and we can
[00:17:17] make the penalty for invading a country
[00:17:18] at least by lamb essentially being
[00:17:20] impossible it should eliminate the kind
[00:17:22] of land battles well this this is Rel
[00:17:23] question is that does it give more of
[00:17:25] advantage to defense versus offense can
[00:17:26] you can you even make that distinction
[00:17:27] because I&#39;ve been doing this for the
[00:17:28] last year I&#39;ve learned a lot about war
[00:17:29] that I really did not want to know and
[00:17:31] one of the things to know about war is
[00:17:32] that the offense always has the
[00:17:33] advantage because you can always
[00:17:35] overwhelm the defensive systems and so
[00:17:37] you&#39;re better off as a strategy of
[00:17:38] National Defense to have a very strong
[00:17:40] offense that you can use if you need to
[00:17:42] and the systems that I and others are
[00:17:43] building will do that um because of the
[00:17:45] way the system works I now a licensed I
[00:17:47] think he might have misspoken there let
[00:17:48] me know in the comments if you think so
[00:17:50] too or I&#39;m missing something I think he
[00:17:52] meant to say that he will he and others
[00:17:54] like him will build incredible defensive
[00:17:57] systems to reduce the effectiveness of
[00:17:59] invading and using offensive systems
[00:18:01] that&#39;s how I&#39;m interpreting I think he
[00:18:03] kind of to me it sounds like he misspoke
[00:18:04] a little bit if if I understand
[00:18:05] correctly because of the way the system
[00:18:07] works I am now a licensed arms deer
[00:18:10] others are building we do that um
[00:18:11] because of the way the system works I am
[00:18:13] now a licensed arms dealer so computer
[00:18:15] scientist businessman arms dealer and
[00:18:19] I&#39;m sorry to agression I I don&#39;t know I
[00:18:21] do not recommend this in your Carew I
[00:18:22] stick with they are um and because of
[00:18:24] the way the laws work um we&#39;re doing
[00:18:25] this privately and then it&#39;s this is all
[00:18:27] legal with the support of the
[00:18:28] governments it goes straight into
[00:18:28] Ukraine and then they fight the war and
[00:18:30] and and without going into all the
[00:18:31] details things are pretty bad I think if
[00:18:33] in May or June if the Russians build up
[00:18:36] as they expecting to Ukraine will lose a
[00:18:38] whole chunk of its territory and will
[00:18:39] begin the process of losing the whole
[00:18:40] country so I believe this was recorded
[00:18:42] in August 2024 just a few days ago or at
[00:18:45] least that&#39;s when it was posted if you
[00:18:47] recall the news headlines about it all
[00:18:49] of them are from like a few hours ago so
[00:18:51] I think he&#39;s talking about 2025 I&#39;m
[00:18:54] assuming so he&#39;s talking about May or
[00:18:55] June of 2025 for most of History humans
[00:18:58] sort of had a mystical understanding of
[00:18:59] the universe and then there&#39;s the
[00:19:00] Scientific Revolution and the
[00:19:01] enlightenment um and in your article you
[00:19:03] argue that now these models are becoming
[00:19:05] so complicated and uh difficult to
[00:19:08] understand that we don&#39;t really know
[00:19:09] what&#39;s going on in them I&#39;ll take a
[00:19:11] quote from Richard fean he says what I
[00:19:12] cannot create I do not understand I saw
[00:19:13] this quote the other day but now people
[00:19:15] are creating things they do not that
[00:19:16] that they can create but they don&#39;t
[00:19:16] really understand what&#39;s inside of them
[00:19:17] is the nature of knowledge changing in a
[00:19:19] way are we gonna have to start just
[00:19:20] taking the word for these models without
[00:19:22] them able being able to explain it to us
[00:19:23] the analogy I would offer is to
[00:19:24] teenagers if you have a teenager you
[00:19:26] know that they&#39;re human but you can&#39;t
[00:19:27] quite figure out what they&#39;re thinking
[00:19:29] um but somehow we&#39;ve managed in society
[00:19:30] to adapt to the presence of teenagers
[00:19:32] right and they eventually grow out of
[00:19:33] that and this serious so it&#39;s probably
[00:19:35] the case we&#39;re going to have knowledge
[00:19:37] systems that we cannot fully
[00:19:38] characterize but we understand their
[00:19:40] boundaries right we understand the
[00:19:42] limits of what they can do and that&#39;s
[00:19:43] probably the best outcome we can get do
[00:19:44] you think we&#39;ll understand the limits we
[00:19:46] we&#39;ll get pretty good at it the
[00:19:47] consensus of my group that meets on
[00:19:49] every week is that eventually the way
[00:19:51] you&#39;ll do this it&#39;s called SOC called
[00:19:52] adversarial AI is that there will there
[00:19:54] will actually be companies that you will
[00:19:56] hire and pay money to to break your AI
[00:19:58] system so it&#39;ll be the r instead of
[00:19:59] human red teams which is what they do
[00:20:00] today you&#39;ll have whole companies and a
[00:20:02] whole industry of AI systems whose jobs
[00:20:04] are to break the existing AI systems and
[00:20:05] find their vulnerabilities especially
[00:20:07] the knowledge that they have that we
[00:20:08] can&#39;t figure out that makes sense to me
[00:20:09] it&#39;s also a great project for you here
[00:20:11] at Stanford because if you have a
[00:20:12] graduate student who has to figure out
[00:20:13] how to attack one of these large models
[00:20:15] and understand what it does that is a
[00:20:16] great skill to build the Next Generation
[00:20:18] so it makes sense to me that the two
[00:20:19] will travel together if that&#39;s something
[00:20:21] that interests you there&#39;s a Twitter SLX
[00:20:23] account Pini The prompter Who uh
[00:20:25] basically jailbreaks a lot of these
[00:20:27] models usually within a few days of
[00:20:28] their release so he&#39;s just of course one
[00:20:30] of uh many people that do sort of things
[00:20:33] like that he does it kind of simly for
[00:20:35] entertainment and for online media
[00:20:38] Clouts but if you think about it third
[00:20:40] party testing third party red teaming of
[00:20:43] AI models third party quality assurance
[00:20:45] right QA of these models as they roll
[00:20:48] out and have contact with consumers with
[00:20:50] businesses with organizations Etc as
[00:20:52] well as just with various infrastructure
[00:20:54] systems and factories automations Etc
[00:20:57] war of course that&#39;s going to be a Big
[00:20:58] Industry that doesn&#39;t really exist yet
[00:21:01] it it just is beginning to grow and yet
[00:21:04] that might be something interesting and
[00:21:06] profitable to get into if that&#39;s uh
[00:21:08] that&#39;s your cup of tea next he comments
[00:21:10] just a bit on adver serial AI you just
[00:21:13] mentioned adversarial I&#39;m wonder if
[00:21:15] elaborate on that more it seems to be
[00:21:16] besides obviously increase get more
[00:21:18] perform mod getting them to do what you
[00:21:20] want
[00:21:22] isue well you have to assume that the
[00:21:24] current hallucination problems become
[00:21:26] less right in as the technology gets
[00:21:28] better and so forth I&#39;m not suggesting
[00:21:29] it goes away and then you also have to
[00:21:31] assume that there are tests for efficacy
[00:21:33] so there has to be a way of knowing that
[00:21:34] the thing succeeded so in the example
[00:21:36] that I gave of the Tik Tok competitor
[00:21:37] and by the way I was not arguing that
[00:21:38] you should illegally steal everybody&#39;s
[00:21:39] music what you would do if you&#39;re a
[00:21:40] silicon value entrepreneur which
[00:21:41] hopefully all of you will be is if it
[00:21:43] took off then you&#39;d hire a whole bunch
[00:21:44] of lawyers to go clean the mess up right
[00:21:45] but if if nobody uses your product it
[00:21:47] doesn&#39;t matter that you stole all the
[00:21:48] content and do not quote me right right
[00:21:51] you&#39;re on camera that&#39;s right but you
[00:21:53] see my point in other words Silicon
[00:21:54] Valley will run these tests and clean up
[00:21:55] the mess and that&#39;s typically how those
[00:21:56] things are done so so my own View is
[00:21:58] that you&#39;ll see more and more um
[00:22:00] performative systems with even better
[00:22:02] test and eventually adversarial tests
[00:22:03] and that&#39;ll keep it within a box the
[00:22:05] technical term is called Chain of
[00:22:06] Thought reasoning and people believe
[00:22:07] that in the next few years you&#39;ll be
[00:22:09] able to generate a thousand steps of
[00:22:10] Chain of Thought reasoning right do this
[00:22:12] do this it&#39;s like building recipes right
[00:22:13] that the recipes you can run the recipe
[00:22:15] and you can actually test that It
[00:22:16] produced the correct outcome and that&#39;s
[00:22:17] how the system will work next they ask
[00:22:19] what&#39;s going to be driving AI progress
[00:22:20] is it more data more compute is it just
[00:22:23] like chips and Hardware the amounts of
[00:22:24] money being thrown around are
[00:22:26] mindboggling and um I&#39;ve chose I
[00:22:29] essentially invest in everything because
[00:22:30] I can&#39;t figure out who&#39;s going to win
[00:22:31] and the amounts of money that are
[00:22:33] following me are so large I think some
[00:22:35] of it is because the early money has
[00:22:36] been made and the big money people who
[00:22:37] don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing have to
[00:22:38] have an AI component and everything is
[00:22:40] now an AI investment so they can&#39;t tell
[00:22:41] the difference I Define ai as Learning
[00:22:43] Systems systems that actually learn so I
[00:22:44] think that&#39;s one of them the second is
[00:22:46] that there are very sophisticated new
[00:22:47] algorithms that are sort of post
[00:22:48] Transformers my friend my collaborator
[00:22:50] for a long time has invented a new non-
[00:22:51] Transformer architecture there&#39;s a group
[00:22:53] that I&#39;m funding in Paris that has
[00:22:54] claims to done the same thing so there&#39;s
[00:22:56] enormous invention there a lot of things
[00:22:57] at Stanford and the final thing is that
[00:22:59] there is a belief in the market that the
[00:23:01] invention of intelligence has infinite
[00:23:03] return so let&#39;s say you have you put $50
[00:23:05] billion of capital into a company you
[00:23:07] have to make an awful lot of money from
[00:23:08] intelligence to pay that back I mean
[00:23:10] when you phrase it like that it seems to
[00:23:11] make sense if you invent intelligence
[00:23:14] certainly that would have an infinite
[00:23:17] return so it&#39;s probably the case that
[00:23:18] we&#39;ll go through some huge investment
[00:23:20] bubble and then it&#39;ll sort itself out
[00:23:21] that&#39;s always been true in the past and
[00:23:23] it&#39;s likely to be true here and what you
[00:23:24] said earlier was you think that the
[00:23:26] leaders are pulling away from right now
[00:23:27] right now and and
[00:23:29] this is a really the question is roughly
[00:23:31] the following there&#39;s a company called
[00:23:32] mrr in France they done a really good
[00:23:34] job um and I&#39;m obviously an investor um
[00:23:36] they have produced their second version
[00:23:38] their third model is likely to be closed
[00:23:39] because it&#39;s so expensive they need
[00:23:41] revenue and they can&#39;t give their model
[00:23:42] away so this open source versus closed
[00:23:44] Source debate in our industry is huge
[00:23:46] and um my entire career was based on
[00:23:49] people being willing to share software
[00:23:50] in open source everything about me is
[00:23:52] open source much of Google&#39;s
[00:23:53] underpinnings were open source
[00:23:54] everything I&#39;ve done technically and yet
[00:23:56] it may be that the capital costs which
[00:23:57] are so immense fundamentally changes how
[00:23:59] software is built you and I were talking
[00:24:01] um my own view of software programmers
[00:24:03] is that software programmers
[00:24:04] productivity will at least double there
[00:24:05] are three or four software companies
[00:24:07] that are trying to do that I&#39;ve invested
[00:24:08] in all of them in and they&#39;re all trying
[00:24:10] to make software programmers more
[00:24:11] productive the most interesting one that
[00:24:12] I just met with is called augment and I
[00:24:14] always think of an individual programmer
[00:24:15] and they said that&#39;s not our Target our
[00:24:16] Target are these 100 person software
[00:24:17] programming teams on millions of lines
[00:24:19] of code where nobody knows what&#39;s going
[00:24:20] on that&#39;s a really good AI thing will
[00:24:22] they make money I hope so you mentioned
[00:24:24] that there&#39;s the combination of the
[00:24:25] context exension the agents and the text
[00:24:27] to action is going to unimaginable
[00:24:29] impacts first of all why is the
[00:24:31] combination important and second of all
[00:24:32] I know that you know you&#39;re not like a
[00:24:33] crystal ball and you can&#39;t necessarily
[00:24:35] tell the future but why do you think
[00:24:36] it&#39;s beyond anything that we could
[00:24:37] imagine I think largely because the
[00:24:38] context window allows you to solve the
[00:24:40] problem of recency the current models
[00:24:42] take a year to train roughly six six
[00:24:44] there 18 months six months of
[00:24:45] preparation six months of training six
[00:24:46] months of fine tuning so they&#39;re always
[00:24:47] out of date context window you can feed
[00:24:50] what happened like you can ask it
[00:24:51] questions about the uh the Hamas Israel
[00:24:53] war right in a context that&#39;s very
[00:24:55] powerful it becomes current like Google
[00:24:56] um in the case of Agents I&#39;ll give you
[00:24:58] an example I set up a foundation which
[00:24:59] is funding a nonprofit which starts
[00:25:01] there&#39;s a I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s
[00:25:02] Chemists in the room that I don&#39;t really
[00:25:03] understand chemistry there&#39;s a a tool
[00:25:05] called chro CW which was an LM based
[00:25:08] system that learned chemistry and what
[00:25:09] they do is they run it to generate
[00:25:10] chemistry hypotheses about proteins and
[00:25:12] they have a lab which runs the tests
[00:25:14] overnight and then it learns that&#39;s a
[00:25:16] huge acceleration accelerant in
[00:25:17] chemistry Material Science and so forth
[00:25:19] so that&#39;s that&#39;s an agent model and I
[00:25:21] think the text to action can be
[00:25:21] understood by just having a lot of sheet
[00:25:23] programmers right um and I don&#39;t think
[00:25:25] we understand what happens and this is
[00:25:26] again your area of expertise what happen
[00:25:28] happens when everyone has their own
[00:25:29] programmer I&#39;m not talking about turning
[00:25:30] on and off the lights you know I imagine
[00:25:32] another example um for some reason you
[00:25:34] don&#39;t like Google so you say build me a
[00:25:35] Google competitor yeah you personally
[00:25:37] you don&#39;t build me a Google competitor
[00:25:38] uh search the web build a UI make a good
[00:25:41] copy um add generative AI in an
[00:25:43] interesting way do it in 30 seconds and
[00:25:45] see if it works right so a lot of people
[00:25:49] believe that the incumbents including
[00:25:50] Google are vulnerable to this kind of an
[00:25:52] attack now we&#39;ll see there were a bunch
[00:25:53] of questions who were sent over by
[00:25:54] slider I want to give some of them
[00:25:55] upload so um here&#39;s one um we talked a
[00:25:57] little about this last year um how can
[00:25:58] we stop AI from influencing public
[00:25:59] opinion misinformation especially during
[00:26:00] the upcoming he&#39;s asked a bit about
[00:26:02] misinformation how can we prevent AI
[00:26:05] from causing misinformation he talks
[00:26:07] about how during his time working with
[00:26:08] YouTube that was a problem people would
[00:26:10] upload a video for profit for their own
[00:26:13] self-gain and as a result of
[00:26:15] misinformation he says well people could
[00:26:17] be hurt he even says people die so
[00:26:19] certainly that is a problem if you saw
[00:26:22] my yesterday&#39;s video about grock 2 and
[00:26:24] the images it generates they&#39;re very re
[00:26:26] looking and grock 2 does not seem to
[00:26:29] have any sort of safety rails in place
[00:26:31] it just generates whatever you ask for
[00:26:33] so heading into the selection certainly
[00:26:35] that could be an issue he talks a little
[00:26:37] bit about some sort of a digital
[00:26:38] authentication or a public key
[00:26:40] authentication basically if somebody
[00:26:42] like the president speaks there&#39;s some
[00:26:44] key that everybody else can verify
[00:26:46] saying okay this is him this is his
[00:26:48] original audio he mentions briefly that
[00:26:50] it&#39;s it seems like he&#39;s saying it&#39;s a
[00:26:51] shame that the American universities
[00:26:53] aren&#39;t getting as much resources for
[00:26:56] computes for Google cloud and other
[00:26:58] places like that and this explosion
[00:27:00] where all the big companies are
[00:27:01] basically gobbling up the available
[00:27:03] resources and so he&#39;s saying the right
[00:27:05] thing for us to do is to get them the
[00:27:07] resources they need to give the
[00:27:08] universities the compute the resources
[00:27:10] that they need to pursue research and
[00:27:12] development and all that stuff next they
[00:27:13] talk about automation who&#39;s getting
[00:27:15] replaced who&#39;s getting to be obsolete in
[00:27:18] the labor force so let&#39;s take a look at
[00:27:20] that really fast I&#39;ll defer to the real
[00:27:22] expert here uh as your amateur Economist
[00:27:24] taught by Eric um I I fundamentally
[00:27:27] believe that the the sort of college
[00:27:28] education High skills task will be fine
[00:27:30] because people will work with these
[00:27:31] systems I think the systems is no
[00:27:33] different from any other technology wave
[00:27:34] the dangerous jobs and the jobs which
[00:27:35] require very little human judgment will
[00:27:37] get replaced the next question is kind
[00:27:39] of like the global balance of AI power
[00:27:42] so the person asking the question
[00:27:43] specifically mentions us and China but
[00:27:46] as you see here Eric specifically
[00:27:48] focuses on India take a listen the most
[00:27:50] interesting country is India because the
[00:27:52] top AI people come from India to the us
[00:27:54] and we should let India keep some of its
[00:27:56] top talent not all of them but some of
[00:27:57] them um and they don&#39;t have the kind of
[00:27:58] training facilities and programs that we
[00:28:00] so richly have here to me India is the
[00:28:01] big swing state in that regard China&#39;s
[00:28:03] Lost it&#39;s not going to not going to come
[00:28:04] back they&#39;re not going to change the
[00:28:05] regime as much as people wish them to do
[00:28:07] Japan and Korea are clearly in our camp
[00:28:09] Taiwan is a fantastic country whose
[00:28:11] software is terrible so that&#39;s not gonna
[00:28:12] going to work um amazing hard and in the
[00:28:15] rest of the world there are not a lot of
[00:28:16] other good choices that are big German
[00:28:18] the Europe is screwed up because of
[00:28:19] Brussels it&#39;s not a new fact I spent 10
[00:28:20] years fighting them and I work really
[00:28:22] hard to get them to fix the the EU act
[00:28:24] and they still have all the restrictions
[00:28:26] that make it very difficult to do our
[00:28:27] kind of research in Europe my French
[00:28:28] friends have spent all their time
[00:28:29] battling Brussels and mcon who&#39;s a
[00:28:31] personal friend is fighting hard for
[00:28:33] this and so France I think has a chance
[00:28:34] I don&#39;t see I don&#39;t see Germany coming
[00:28:35] and the rest is not big
[00:28:36] enough yes ma&#39;am so I know you&#39;re an
[00:28:39] engineer by
[00:28:40] trainer um given the capabilities that
[00:28:43] you Enis these mod should we still spend
[00:28:44] Hing to yeah because because ultimately
[00:28:46] it&#39;s it&#39;s the old thing of why do you
[00:28:47] study English if you can speak English
[00:28:49] you get better at it right you really do
[00:28:50] need to understand how these systems
[00:28:51] work and I feel very strong yes sir yeah
[00:28:53] I&#39;m curious if you explore good answer
[00:28:55] distributed setting and I&#39;m asking
[00:28:56] because sure like making a large cluster
[00:28:58] but Ma are powerful there&#39;s a lot of
[00:28:59] small maches across the world so like
[00:29:01] you think like folding at home are a
[00:29:02] similar idea works for training yeah we
[00:29:04] look very hard this so the way the
[00:29:06] algorithms work is you have a very large
[00:29:07] Matrix and you have essentially a
[00:29:08] multiplication function so think of it
[00:29:10] as going back and forth and back and
[00:29:12] forth and these systems are completely
[00:29:13] limited by the speed of memory to CPU or
[00:29:15] GPU and in fact the next iteration of
[00:29:18] Nvidia chips has combined all those
[00:29:20] functions into one chip the chips are
[00:29:21] now so big that they glue them all
[00:29:22] together and in fact the package is so
[00:29:24] sensitive the package is put together in
[00:29:26] a clean room as well as the chip itself
[00:29:27] so the looks like supercomputers and
[00:29:29] speed of light especially memory
[00:29:31] interconnect really dominated so I think
[00:29:32] unlikely for a while is there a way to
[00:29:33] segment the element like so Jeff de last
[00:29:35] year when he spoke here talked about
[00:29:36] having these different parts of it you
[00:29:38] train separately and then kind of
[00:29:39] Federate them each you know in order to
[00:29:41] do that you&#39;d have to have 10 million
[00:29:42] such things and then you&#39;re the way you
[00:29:44] ask the questions would be too slow he&#39;s
[00:29:45] talking about eight or 10 12 not at Lev
[00:29:49] the back way back I know like after
[00:29:51] releas new yor time open using work for
[00:29:53] training do you think
[00:29:54] that&#39;s I used to do a lot of work on the
[00:29:56] music licensing stuff what I learned was
[00:29:58] that in the 60s there was a series of
[00:30:00] lawsuits that resulted in an agreement
[00:30:02] where you get a a stipulated royalty
[00:30:04] whenever your song is played even even
[00:30:06] they don&#39;t even know who you are so paid
[00:30:07] into a bank and my guess is it&#39;ll be the
[00:30:08] same thing there be lots of lawsuits and
[00:30:09] there&#39;ll be some kind of stipulated
[00:30:10] agreement which will just say you have
[00:30:12] to pay x per of whatever Revenue you
[00:30:14] have in order to use pass cap BMI cap
[00:30:16] BMI look them up it&#39;s long it will seem
[00:30:17] very old to you but I think that&#39;s how
[00:30:18] it will yes sir interesting like there&#39;s
[00:30:21] a few players that are dominating AI
[00:30:23] right they&#39;ll continue to dominate and
[00:30:24] they seem to overlap with the large
[00:30:25] companies that all the antitrust
[00:30:27] regulation is kind of focus on how do
[00:30:28] you see those two Trends kind of yeah
[00:30:30] like do you see Regulators breaking up
[00:30:31] these companies and how will that affect
[00:30:33] the yeah so in my career I helped
[00:30:36] Microsoft get broken up and it wasn&#39;t
[00:30:37] broken up and I fought fought for Google
[00:30:39] to not be broken up and it&#39;s not been
[00:30:40] broken up so it sure looks to me like
[00:30:41] the trend is not to be broken up um as
[00:30:43] long as the companies avoid being John D
[00:30:45] Rockefeller the senior and I studied
[00:30:46] this looked it up it&#39;s how antitrust law
[00:30:48] came I don&#39;t think the government is
[00:30:49] will act the re the reason you&#39;re seeing
[00:30:51] these large companies dominate is who
[00:30:52] has the capital to build these data
[00:30:54] centers right right so my friend Reed
[00:30:56] and my friend com
[00:30:58] two have we talked to you about the
[00:31:00] decision that they made to take
[00:31:01] inflection so I believe Mustafa he&#39;s
[00:31:02] talking about Mustafa siman who is the
[00:31:04] co-founder of Google Deep Mind friend
[00:31:06] Reed and my friend M coming next we two
[00:31:08] week have Reed talked to you about the
[00:31:10] decision that they made to take
[00:31:11] inflection and essentially PE part it
[00:31:12] into Microsoft basically they decided
[00:31:14] they couldn&#39;t raise the tens of billions
[00:31:15] of dollars is that number public that
[00:31:16] you mentioned earlier have
[00:31:18] have
[00:31:20] got we want
[00:31:24] this I was wondering where all this is
[00:31:26] going to leave countries where in b
[00:31:27] ipants in phun models and access to
[00:31:30] compu the rich get richer and the poor
[00:31:32] do the best they can um they&#39;ll have to
[00:31:34] the fact of the matter is this is a rich
[00:31:36] country&#39;s game right huge Capital lots
[00:31:38] of technically strong people strong
[00:31:39] government support right there are two
[00:31:41] examples there lots of other countries
[00:31:43] that have all sorts of problems they
[00:31:43] don&#39;t have those resources they&#39;ll have
[00:31:44] to find a partner they&#39;ll have to join
[00:31:46] with somebody else something like that I
[00:31:48] last we met you he&#39;s fairly blunt he&#39;s
[00:31:50] fairly straightforward he I think kind
[00:31:52] of calls it how he sees it and it really
[00:31:55] seems like he&#39;s not talking one side or
[00:31:56] the other he doesn&#39;t have he&#39;s not
[00:31:58] pumping his back so to speak so he&#39;s not
[00:32:00] saying the things that benefit his
[00:32:01] portfolio or whatever he&#39;s just like
[00:32:03] yeah this is how it&#39;s going to be this
[00:32:04] is how it works by default big companies
[00:32:06] are not going to broken up the rich get
[00:32:07] richer Etc and finally he&#39;s asked a
[00:32:10] little bit more about kind of the
[00:32:11] business and entrepreneur side of things
[00:32:13] if you&#39;re starting your own company you
[00:32:15] have a product idea what does that look
[00:32:16] like how do you develop it how do you
[00:32:18] create a lot of wealth with your own
[00:32:20] product here&#39;s his answer I want I think
[00:32:23] the last we met you you at hackathon at
[00:32:24] AGI house and I know you spent a lot of
[00:32:26] time helping like young people as they
[00:32:27] create a lot of wealth and you spoke
[00:32:28] very passionately about about wanting to
[00:32:30] to do that do you have any advice for
[00:32:31] folks here as they&#39;re building their
[00:32:32] they&#39;re writing their business PL for
[00:32:33] this class or policy proposals or
[00:32:34] research proposals um you know at this
[00:32:36] stage of the careers going forward well
[00:32:39] um I teach a class in the business
[00:32:40] school on this so you should come to my
[00:32:41] class um the I am struck by the speed
[00:32:44] which with which you can build
[00:32:46] demonstrations of new ideas so in that
[00:32:49] in one of the hack I did the winning
[00:32:51] team the command was fly the Drone
[00:32:53] between two towers and it was given a
[00:32:54] virtual drone space and it figured out
[00:32:56] how to fly the Drone what the word
[00:32:57] between them generated the code in
[00:32:58] Python and flew the Drone in the
[00:32:59] simulator through the tower I just it
[00:33:01] would have taken a week or two you know
[00:33:03] good professional programmers to do that
[00:33:05] um I&#39;m telling you that the ability to
[00:33:06] prototype quickly really you know part
[00:33:08] part of the problem being an
[00:33:09] entrepreneur is everything happens
[00:33:10] faster well now if you can&#39;t get your
[00:33:12] prototype built in a day using these
[00:33:14] various tools you need to think about
[00:33:16] that right because that&#39;s who your
[00:33:17] competitor is doing so I guess my
[00:33:18] biggest advice is when you start
[00:33:19] thinking about a company is find the
[00:33:20] right a business CL plan in fact you
[00:33:22] should ask the computer to write your
[00:33:23] business plan for you
[00:33:25] um talk about that after leave it and
[00:33:28] and but I think it&#39;s very important to
[00:33:30] prototype your idea using these tools as
[00:33:32] quickly as you can because you can be
[00:33:33] sure there&#39;s another person doing
[00:33:34] exactly that same thing in another
[00:33:36] company in another University in a place
[00:33:38] that You&#39; all right
[00:33:40] thank very cool so this piece was uh
[00:33:43] taken down so apparently it&#39;s not even
[00:33:44] online right now but hopefully those few
[00:33:47] little Clips give you glips about what
[00:33:49] he thinks of AI you know I&#39;ve kind of
[00:33:51] cut out all the pieces that I think
[00:33:53] caused the controversy or whatever that
[00:33:55] situation was I don&#39;t think it really
[00:33:56] had anything to do with AI or anything
[00:33:58] of of substance I mean maybe touched on
[00:34:01] some political issues but whatever this
[00:34:03] is a person with a lot of really
[00:34:05] technical background and even though
[00:34:07] he&#39;s more of like a business guy he is
[00:34:10] spoken of with a lot of respect by all
[00:34:12] the engineers and all the very highly
[00:34:14] technical people in the Bay Area in the
[00:34:16] Silicon Valley he&#39;s somebody that really
[00:34:17] understands the tech space looks like
[00:34:19] Forbes has him listed as having a netw
[00:34:21] worth of almost $24 billion he&#39;s good
[00:34:25] friends he said with Sam Alman president
[00:34:27] of France France sounds like he knows
[00:34:29] all the co-founders of various AI
[00:34:31] companies big and small I mean this is
[00:34:33] somebody that&#39;s very very on the inside
[00:34:35] this is somebody that knows where things
[00:34:37] are going so certainly when he says
[00:34:39] something I tend to listen I put a great
[00:34:41] deal of weight into what he&#39;s saying and
[00:34:43] what he&#39;s saying is this AI wave is just
[00:34:47] starting we have two massive countries
[00:34:49] two big countries with the capital and
[00:34:50] the talent and everything else that&#39;s
[00:34:52] needed that are vying for AI Supremacy
[00:34:54] the issues with the chips and the power
[00:34:56] and the data while those are bottlenecks
[00:34:59] it seems like they will slowly be
[00:35:01] perhaps even maybe not that slowly
[00:35:03] slowly but but be improved you mentioned
[00:35:05] building data centers and various other
[00:35:07] AI infrastructure in Canada potentially
[00:35:10] which makes a lot of sense if you think
[00:35:12] about it lots of open land tends to be
[00:35:14] colder which again you know Heating and
[00:35:17] the generation of heat and having to
[00:35:19] cool these facilities is a concern tons
[00:35:22] land very friendly government to the US
[00:35:24] you know in factorio how do you just
[00:35:26] like find a big chunk of the map where
[00:35:28] there&#39;s a lot of open land and you&#39;d
[00:35:30] build all your nuclear power plants
[00:35:32] you&#39;d build out your entire like
[00:35:34] electricity infrastructure there just
[00:35:36] have a cable going back to where you
[00:35:38] need electricity to be it begs the
[00:35:40] question is this the future of Canada
[00:35:42] I&#39;m only kidding of course folks but the
[00:35:45] more and more I think about it there is
[00:35:46] a lot of land it&#39;s close by and it&#39;s
[00:35:49] cold and certainly that would be
[00:35:51] phenomenal for the revenue of Canada to
[00:35:53] generate some sort of tax some sort of
[00:35:55] Revenue based on right one of the kind
[00:35:57] of superpowers building out the
[00:35:59] infrastructure it needs to stay dominant
[00:36:01] in the AI race right I mean they&#39;re
[00:36:03] talking about creating 100 billion doll
[00:36:06] data centers potentially even the
[00:36:08] estimates a size 300 billion so that&#39;s
[00:36:10] that&#39;s one company that&#39;s not even the
[00:36:12] US government supported projects that&#39;s
[00:36:15] just a publicly traded company doing
[00:36:17] that sounds like he&#39;s really believing
[00:36:19] in Nvidia and the power of Nvidia and
[00:36:21] it&#39;s Cuda sort of software that the
[00:36:24] chips run on and if I&#39;m understanding
[00:36:26] him correctly he&#39;s not really seeing any
[00:36:28] competition to that I mean there&#39;s some
[00:36:30] things in the Horizon maybe possibly but
[00:36:32] nothing yet so it sounds like a lot of
[00:36:35] this money like a lot of it will be
[00:36:36] flowing into Nvidia and of course this
[00:36:39] idea that as the context window expands
[00:36:41] it&#39;ll become more and more sort of
[00:36:44] similar to training in a sense that
[00:36:46] right if it takes a while to train up a
[00:36:47] model but it can do in context learning
[00:36:50] meaning that you&#39;re able to just upload
[00:36:51] books and stuff to the finished model
[00:36:53] it&#39;s able to learn from them which we&#39;ve
[00:36:54] seen that with Gemini they found a
[00:36:56] language that doesn&#39;t have an a lot of
[00:36:57] online presence only something like 24
[00:37:00] people in the world speak it but they
[00:37:01] have some notebooks and manuscripts and
[00:37:03] stuff like that they uploaded to gini
[00:37:05] the actual finished trained Gemini and
[00:37:08] that model was able to learn how to
[00:37:11] speak it how to create sentences in it
[00:37:13] it wasn&#39;t trained on it it would learned
[00:37:15] in context right so as the context
[00:37:18] window ramps up to 10 million tokens
[00:37:21] that certainly seems like it would
[00:37:22] change how we think about pre- and
[00:37:25] posttraining or in other words once the
[00:37:27] model is trained it doesn&#39;t stop
[00:37:29] learning if you wanted to learn about a
[00:37:31] specific thing that you wanted to learn
[00:37:33] about maybe it&#39;s you know you have a
[00:37:34] company or that that have millions of
[00:37:37] documents and procedures and stuff like
[00:37:39] that just kind of like everywhere but no
[00:37:41] one person understands all of it well in
[00:37:43] the past that was kind of useless it
[00:37:45] doesn&#39;t really help you but if you can
[00:37:47] upload it to a model like that all of a
[00:37:49] sudden it knows all those things about
[00:37:51] your company it can train people on it
[00:37:54] it can answer your questions it can kind
[00:37:55] of manage it update see if there&#39;s any
[00:37:58] conflicts anywhere in it so instead of
[00:38:00] training a brand new model on that you
[00:38:02] just use an existing model and upload
[00:38:04] that stuff into the 10 million token
[00:38:07] context window combine that with text to
[00:38:09] action which is another word I&#39;ve heard
[00:38:11] it before this phrase but it&#39;s not that
[00:38:14] often used I feel like but yeah I mean
[00:38:16] that&#39;s what agents are basically right
[00:38:18] it&#39;s text to action you type in impr
[00:38:21] prompt and it goes and does that action
[00:38:23] it does the thing you&#39;re asking it to do
[00:38:25] as they get better at long-term plan
[00:38:27] long-term reasoning and actually Deep
[00:38:29] Mind CEO de saabi is also just had an
[00:38:32] interview talking about something very
[00:38:34] very similar he&#39;s talking about this
[00:38:36] idea that as agents become better
[00:38:38] long-term reasoners and planners they
[00:38:40] will become better and better at
[00:38:42] carrying out those long Horizon tasks
[00:38:44] and he&#39;s saying we&#39;re not ready for it
[00:38:46] when everybody can have these qualified
[00:38:49] capable agents right he&#39;s saying it&#39;s
[00:38:51] going to have an impact on the world at
[00:38:53] a scale no one understands yet and that
[00:38:56] certainly I think is true that&#39;s
[00:38:58] certainly something that I fully agree
[00:39:00] with a lot of our social structures and
[00:39:03] stuff we&#39;re kind of used to will have to
[00:39:05] change and of course he&#39;s saying if
[00:39:06] you&#39;re worried about losing your job
[00:39:08] having a degree that&#39;s going to become
[00:39:09] worthless you know should you still
[00:39:11] learn to code he&#39;s saying business as
[00:39:13] usual there yes some easy simple jobs or
[00:39:16] maybe very dangerous jobs jobs where
[00:39:18] there&#39;s not a lot of hard decisions to
[00:39:20] be made yes those might go away and yes
[00:39:23] these AIS might be pretty good at coding
[00:39:25] creating projects but learning all those
[00:39:27] skills getting better at those skills
[00:39:28] learning how everything works that&#39;s
[00:39:30] that&#39;s not going out of fashion that&#39;s
[00:39:32] never going to just disappear his
[00:39:34] example was you know if you can speak
[00:39:36] English why would you learn English
[00:39:38] right why would you study English well
[00:39:40] it&#39;s to get better at it to improve your
[00:39:42] abilities with it so I hope you enjoyed
[00:39:44] that make sure you subscribed please
[00:39:46] give me a thumbs up if you enjoyed it my
[00:39:48] name is Wes rth and I&#39;ll see you next
[00:39:49] time thank you for watching
[00:00:00] Eric Schmidt gave a facety talk at
[00:00:02] Stanford just a few days ago about AI he
[00:00:05] was of course the former Google CEO and
[00:00:08] perceived by people as a bit of a
[00:00:10] futurist he&#39;s able to kind of often very
[00:00:12] accurately predict where technology is
[00:00:14] going the interview was over an hour
[00:00:16] long and it was fascinating covering
[00:00:18] topics like ai ai agents where this
[00:00:20] whole thing is going Etc and had a lot
[00:00:22] of pretty brilliant insights by Eric
[00:00:25] into where he believes this is going but
[00:00:28] unfortunately at our plus long interview
[00:00:30] there was just one comment that people
[00:00:32] didn&#39;t like the media machine went into
[00:00:35] overdrive mode and the video has been
[00:00:38] basically taken down it&#39;s no longer
[00:00:40] available to see it was deemed too hot
[00:00:43] for the internet and no longer available
[00:00:45] but just between you and me and keep
[00:00:48] this on the DL please I might have a
[00:00:51] copy of it maybe allegedly I feel like I
[00:00:54] need to say something here that reduces
[00:00:55] my liability some sort of a legal
[00:00:58] statement like I take no resp
[00:00:59] responsibility for my actions yeah that
[00:01:01] should do subscribe for more sweet AI
[00:01:03] content let&#39;s take a look at a few clips
[00:01:05] from this Stanford lecture by Eric
[00:01:08] Schmidt about AI I think you will like
[00:01:10] it if you do hit that thumbs up please
[00:01:13] because this is somebody that has a bit
[00:01:14] of a Clairvoyance about the future of
[00:01:16] tech he tends to see how things will
[00:01:18] unfold with startling accuracy so before
[00:01:21] he starts talking he asks the class to
[00:01:23] basically Define what a context window
[00:01:25] is and what AI agents are context
[00:01:28] Windows of course you can think of it as
[00:01:29] sort of a short-term memory it&#39;s
[00:01:31] basically the amount of words that a
[00:01:33] large language model can read and also
[00:01:36] write and output and kind of interact
[00:01:38] with right so if it has a large context
[00:01:40] window you can give it a whole book and
[00:01:42] then ask it questions about the book if
[00:01:44] it has a very short context window we
[00:01:46] might start answering a question and
[00:01:47] then halfway through forget what I was
[00:01:49] talking about it would be kind of a
[00:01:50] whoops I run out of memory type of thing
[00:01:52] and AI agents are things they can sort
[00:01:55] of complete tasks on your behalf you can
[00:01:56] tell them to go order something off of
[00:01:58] Amazon they&#39;ll go they&#39;ll search they&#39;ll
[00:02:00] do reviews they&#39;ll check the sizes the
[00:02:02] colors whatever and then order it and
[00:02:04] then report that they&#39;ve done it back to
[00:02:05] you so you can think of it as kind of a
[00:02:07] smart intern that&#39;s online that&#39;s Ai and
[00:02:10] Eric is talking about potentially a
[00:02:11] seeing a 10 million token context window
[00:02:15] sometime soon potentially in next two
[00:02:17] years or so he doesn&#39;t specify a
[00:02:19] timeline but soon so the first thing he
[00:02:21] talks about is what are we going to
[00:02:23] expect to happen in the next 2 to 5
[00:02:26] years so in the short term specifically
[00:02:29] at the intersection of something like a
[00:02:31] 10 million token context window and
[00:02:33] improving autonomous AI agents take a
[00:02:35] listen so an agent is something that
[00:02:37] does that does some kind of a task
[00:02:39] another definition would be that it&#39;s an
[00:02:40] LM State and memory okay can anybody
[00:02:44] again scientist can can any of you
[00:02:45] define text action taking text and
[00:02:47] turning into an action right here go
[00:02:48] ahead yes instead of taking text and
[00:02:50] turning it into more text more text
[00:02:52] taking text and have the AI trigger
[00:02:54] actions based so another definition
[00:02:56] would be language to python a pro
[00:02:59] programming language I never wanted to
[00:03:00] see survive and and everything in AI is
[00:03:02] being done in Python there&#39;s a new
[00:03:03] language called Mojo that has just come
[00:03:05] out which looks like they finally have
[00:03:06] addressed AI programming but we&#39;ll see
[00:03:07] if that actually survives over the
[00:03:08] dominance of python um one more
[00:03:10] technical question why is NVIDIA worth2
[00:03:12] trillion doll and the other companies
[00:03:14] are struggling technical answer I mean I
[00:03:16] think it just boils down to like most of
[00:03:17] code needs to run with C optimizations
[00:03:19] that currently only support so other
[00:03:21] companies can make whatever they want to
[00:03:22] but unless they have the 10 years of
[00:03:24] software there you don&#39;t have the
[00:03:25] machine learning optimization I like to
[00:03:27] think of Cuda as the C programming
[00:03:29] language for
[00:03:30] yeah right that&#39;s the way I like to
[00:03:31] think of it was founded in 2008 I always
[00:03:32] thought it was a terrible language and
[00:03:34] yet it&#39;s become dominant there&#39;s another
[00:03:35] Insight there&#39;s a set of Open Source
[00:03:36] libraries which are highly optimized to
[00:03:38] Cuda and not anything else and everybody
[00:03:39] who builds all these Stacks right this
[00:03:41] is completely missed in any of the
[00:03:42] discussions right the com it&#39;s
[00:03:44] technically called VM and a whole bunch
[00:03:45] of libraries like that highly optimized
[00:03:47] Cuda very hard to replicate that if
[00:03:48] you&#39;re a competitor so what does all
[00:03:50] this mean in the next year you&#39;re going
[00:03:52] to see very large context Windows agents
[00:03:56] and text action when they are delivered
[00:03:58] at scale it&#39;s going to have an impact on
[00:03:59] world at a scale that no one understands
[00:04:01] yet much bigger than the horrific impact
[00:04:03] we&#39;ve had on by social media right in my
[00:04:05] view so here&#39;s why in a context window
[00:04:07] you can basically use that as short-term
[00:04:08] memory and I was shocked that context
[00:04:11] Windows get this long the technical
[00:04:12] reasons have to do with the fact that
[00:04:13] it&#39;s hard to serve hard to calculate and
[00:04:14] so forth the interesting thing about
[00:04:15] short-term memory when you feed the you
[00:04:18] ask a question read 20 books you give it
[00:04:20] the text of the books is the query and
[00:04:22] you say tell me what they say it forgets
[00:04:23] the middle which is exactly how human
[00:04:25] brains work too right that&#39;s where we
[00:04:26] are with respect to agents there are
[00:04:28] people who are now building essentially
[00:04:30] llm agents and the way they do it is
[00:04:31] they read something like chemistry they
[00:04:33] discover the principles of chemistry and
[00:04:34] then they test it and then they add that
[00:04:36] back into their understanding right
[00:04:38] that&#39;s extremely powerful and then the
[00:04:40] third thing as I mentioned is text
[00:04:41] action so I&#39;ll give you an example the
[00:04:43] government is in the process of trying
[00:04:45] to ban Tik to we&#39;ll see if that actually
[00:04:46] happens if Tik Tok is banned here&#39;s what
[00:04:48] I propose each and every one of you do
[00:04:49] say to your L the foll make me a copy of
[00:04:53] Tik Tok steal all the users steal all
[00:04:55] the music put my preferences in it
[00:04:57] produce this program in the next 30
[00:04:59] seconds release it and in one hour if
[00:05:01] it&#39;s not viral do something different
[00:05:03] along the same lines that&#39;s the command
[00:05:05] boom boom boom boom right you understand
[00:05:08] how powerful that is if you could go
[00:05:09] from arbitrary language to arbitrary
[00:05:11] digital command which is essentially
[00:05:12] what python in this scenario is imagine
[00:05:14] that each and every human on the planet
[00:05:16] has their own programmer that actually
[00:05:18] does what they want as opposed to the
[00:05:18] programmers that work for me who don&#39;t
[00:05:20] do what I ask or potentially a whole
[00:05:22] Army of AI influencers each with its own
[00:05:25] little tweak that are completely managed
[00:05:28] by these AI agents trying to fill a
[00:05:30] certain Niche a certain Gap a certain
[00:05:32] personality type you can have an
[00:05:34] infinite amount of them boasting 24
[00:05:36] hours a day the programmers here know
[00:05:38] what I&#39;m talking about so imagine a non-
[00:05:39] arrogant programmer that actually does
[00:05:41] what you want and you don&#39;t have to pay
[00:05:42] all that money to and there&#39;s infinite
[00:05:44] supply of these program this is all
[00:05:45] within the next year or two very soon
[00:05:47] those three things and I&#39;m quite
[00:05:49] convinced it&#39;s the union of those three
[00:05:50] things that will happen in the next wave
[00:05:53] so you asked about what else is going to
[00:05:54] happen um every six months I oscillate
[00:05:57] so we&#39;re on a it&#39;s an even odd
[00:05:58] oscillation the moment the gap between
[00:06:01] the frontier models which they&#39;re now
[00:06:02] only three I&#39;ll ref few who they are and
[00:06:05] everybody else appears to me to be
[00:06:06] getting larger six months ago I was
[00:06:08] convinced that the Gap was getting
[00:06:09] smaller so I invested lots of money in
[00:06:10] the little companies now I&#39;m not so sure
[00:06:13] and I&#39;m talking to the big companies and
[00:06:14] the big companies are telling me that
[00:06:15] they need 10 billion 20 billion 50
[00:06:18] billion 100 billion is 100 billion right
[00:06:21] they very very hard I talked Sam
[00:06:23] Stargate is Microsoft and open AI sort
[00:06:26] of co- project where they plan to invest
[00:06:28] a 100 billion into a Data Center and by
[00:06:31] the way that&#39;s not the only project
[00:06:33] where they&#39;re kind of working together
[00:06:34] the other one is the power plant the
[00:06:37] fusion power plant somewhere near
[00:06:39] Seattle Washington in that area that
[00:06:42] they hope could potentially provide a
[00:06:43] lot of you know maybe not unlimited
[00:06:45] energy but clean cheap inexpensive
[00:06:48] energy to power a lot of the stuff next
[00:06:50] he&#39;s talking about what he and Sam Alpin
[00:06:52] talked about Sam Alman is a close friend
[00:06:54] he believes it&#39;s going to take about 300
[00:06:56] billion maybe more I pointed out to him
[00:06:58] that I done the calculation on the
[00:06:59] amount of energy required and I and I
[00:07:02] then in the spirit of full disclosure
[00:07:03] went to the White House on Friday and
[00:07:04] told them that we need to become best
[00:07:06] friends with Canada because Canada has
[00:07:08] really nice people helped invent Ai and
[00:07:10] lots of hydrop power because we as a
[00:07:12] country do not have enough power to do
[00:07:13] this keep in mind too that there&#39;s a lot
[00:07:15] of sort of heat generated in these
[00:07:17] processes so the need to cool these
[00:07:20] buildings these infrastructures you know
[00:07:23] if you&#39;re running it somewhere where
[00:07:24] it&#39;s hot you also have to consider your
[00:07:26] AC Bill running it somewhere where it&#39;s
[00:07:28] naturally cold old could be very you
[00:07:31] know profitable you would greatly slash
[00:07:33] your costs because you don&#39;t have to
[00:07:34] worry about cooling or at least not as
[00:07:37] much the alternative is to have the
[00:07:39] Arabs fund it and I like the Arabs
[00:07:40] personally I spent lots of time there
[00:07:42] right but they&#39;re not going to adhere to
[00:07:43] our national security rules whereas
[00:07:44] Canada and the US are part of a trit
[00:07:46] where that we all so the1 billion $300
[00:07:48] billion data centers electricity starts
[00:07:49] becoming the scarce resource well but
[00:07:51] and by the way if you follow this line
[00:07:52] of reasoning why did I discuss Cuda and
[00:07:54] Nvidia if $300 billion is all going to
[00:07:56] go to Nvidia you know what to do in the
[00:07:57] stock market okay that&#39;s sounds like
[00:07:59] he&#39;s recommending people buy Nvidia not
[00:08:01] a stock recommendation I&#39;m not a
[00:08:03] licens well part of it so we&#39;re need a
[00:08:05] lot more chips but Intel is getting a
[00:08:07] lot of money from the US government
[00:08:08] AMD they&#39;re trying to build you know
[00:08:10] Fabs raise your hand if you have an
[00:08:12] Intel computer in your Intel chip in any
[00:08:14] of your Computing
[00:08:15] devices okay so much for the Monopoly
[00:08:19] well that that&#39;s that&#39;s the point though
[00:08:20] they once did have a monopoly absolutely
[00:08:21] and Nvidia has a monopoly now so are
[00:08:22] those barriers T like like Cuda is that
[00:08:24] is there something that other so I was
[00:08:26] talking to Percy Percy land the other
[00:08:27] day he&#39;s switching between tpus and
[00:08:29] Nvidia depending on what you can get
[00:08:30] access so for those who are not aware
[00:08:32] one big race that&#39;s happening right now
[00:08:34] is kind of the race to produce these
[00:08:37] chips that power AI growth and Nvidia
[00:08:40] has been kind of the I mean you can say
[00:08:41] the Undisputed leader in the field
[00:08:43] producing gpus graphical processing
[00:08:46] units and those have been very effective
[00:08:48] they kind of started with you know
[00:08:50] computer games acceleration because
[00:08:51] instead of running each process kind of
[00:08:53] independently finishing and running the
[00:08:55] next one which could create bottlenecks
[00:08:57] it runs them in parallel so for example
[00:08:59] if you&#39;re rendering and gain them on
[00:09:00] screen right you have some some crazy 3D
[00:09:03] game with solar rays and whatever that&#39;s
[00:09:05] running in you know 30 frames per second
[00:09:07] 60 frames per second you know what I
[00:09:08] mean you need to be able to Rend each
[00:09:10] pixel on the screen in real time you
[00:09:12] can&#39;t wait for it to get rendered you
[00:09:14] have to kind of render it all in
[00:09:16] parallel and gpus were really good at
[00:09:18] that that&#39;s part of the power of why
[00:09:20] Nvidia is so powerful as well as Cuda
[00:09:22] the programming language that they run
[00:09:24] on but we do have other alternatives for
[00:09:26] these AI chips the TPU the tensor
[00:09:29] processing unit is Google&#39;s creation
[00:09:31] recently we&#39;ve also seen Gro which is a
[00:09:34] something that they refer to as a
[00:09:35] language processing unit and lpu there&#39;s
[00:09:38] been some talk of neuromorphic chips
[00:09:41] which are more designed like the human
[00:09:42] brain they&#39;re not digital they&#39;re more
[00:09:44] analog but I don&#39;t know if any progress
[00:09:46] has been made in that field and it
[00:09:48] sounds like Sam Alman is cooking up a
[00:09:51] brand new chip that might eventually go
[00:09:53] on to compete with Nvidia that&#39;s still
[00:09:55] in the very early stages but that&#39;s the
[00:09:57] big question is NVIDIA continue to
[00:10:00] dominate or is somebody going to come
[00:10:01] out with something that&#39;s brand new and
[00:10:03] much much better for AI specifically cuz
[00:10:06] gpus aren&#39;t necessarily the best
[00:10:10] possible sort of architecture for AI
[00:10:14] they happen to be very good they happen
[00:10:15] to be the best thing we have right now
[00:10:17] but nothing&#39;s to say that some different
[00:10:19] architecture can&#39;t be a million times
[00:10:22] better just because it&#39;s built from
[00:10:23] scratch for AI inference and training
[00:10:26] absolutely and Nvidia has a monopoly now
[00:10:28] so are those barriers like like Cuda is
[00:10:30] that is there something that other so I
[00:10:32] was talking to Percy Percy the other day
[00:10:33] he&#39;s switching between tpus and Nvidia
[00:10:35] chips depending on what he can get
[00:10:36] access to because he doesn&#39;t have a
[00:10:38] choice if he had infinite money he would
[00:10:39] today he would pick the b200
[00:10:41] architecture out of Nvidia because it
[00:10:42] would be faster and I&#39;m not suggest I
[00:10:44] mean it&#39;s great to have competition i&#39;
[00:10:45] AMD and Lisa Su at create length they
[00:10:47] have built a a thing which will
[00:10:48] translate from um this Cuda architecture
[00:10:50] that you were describing to their own
[00:10:52] which is called rock it doesn&#39;t quite
[00:10:53] work yet they&#39;re working on it so Lisa
[00:10:55] Sue that&#39;s of AMD so one of the Nidia
[00:10:59] competitors AMD and Lisa Su great length
[00:11:01] they have built a a thing which will
[00:11:03] translate from um this Cuda architecture
[00:11:05] that you were describing to their own
[00:11:06] which is called roam it doesn&#39;t quite
[00:11:07] work yet that get transcribed as cud
[00:11:10] architecture but that&#39;s not what it is
[00:11:12] he&#39;s saying Cuda architecture cud da so
[00:11:14] the Nidia sort of architecture versus
[00:11:16] Rockham I&#39;m not familiar with that one I
[00:11:18] guess that&#39;s amd&#39;s version of Cuda U you
[00:11:21] were at Google for a long time and uh
[00:11:23] they invented the Transformer
[00:11:24] architecture it&#39;s all Peter&#39;s fault
[00:11:26] thanks to uh to brilliant people over
[00:11:27] there like Peter and Jeff and everyone
[00:11:29] um but now it doesn&#39;t seem like they&#39;re
[00:11:32] they kind of lost ini so I guess this is
[00:11:34] the part that caused all the hubub I&#39;m
[00:11:35] just skipping it I&#39;m not touching it
[00:11:37] it&#39;s not really related to AI
[00:11:39] necessarily unfortunately I think
[00:11:41] there&#39;s a lot of overlap with politics
[00:11:42] so I&#39;m just trying to avoid that but it
[00:11:44] seems like he&#39;s saying that it might be
[00:11:45] like a cultural issue but let&#39;s continue
[00:11:48] and see what else they&#39;ve talked about
[00:11:50] yes sir in terms of national security or
[00:11:52] interest have play a role or competition
[00:11:54] with China as well so I was the chairman
[00:11:56] of an AI commission that sort of looked
[00:11:57] at this very carefully and um you can
[00:11:59] read it it&#39;s about 752 pages and I&#39;ll
[00:12:01] just summarize it by saying we&#39;re ahead
[00:12:03] we need to stay ahead and we need lots
[00:12:04] of money to do so our customers were the
[00:12:05] senate in the house um and out of that
[00:12:08] came the chips act and a lot of other
[00:12:09] stuff like that um a rough scenario is
[00:12:12] that the chips act invested billions
[00:12:14] into building out the US infrastructure
[00:12:16] to develop AI chips and also I believe
[00:12:18] that&#39;s what limited a lot of the
[00:12:20] nvidia&#39;s export to China some of the
[00:12:23] best chips the most powerful chips it
[00:12:24] limited the exports to China how much
[00:12:27] they could ship and sell in China how it
[00:12:29] seems like that&#39;s creating a bit of a
[00:12:31] black market of people trying to import
[00:12:33] those into China through other means but
[00:12:36] if you assume the frontier models drive
[00:12:37] forward and a few of the open source
[00:12:39] models it&#39;s likely that a very small
[00:12:40] number of companies can play this game
[00:12:42] countries excuse me what are those
[00:12:43] countries or who are they countries with
[00:12:45] a lot of money and a lot of talent
[00:12:46] strong Educational Systems and a
[00:12:47] willingness to win the US is one of them
[00:12:49] China is another one how many others are
[00:12:51] there are there any
[00:12:52] others I don&#39;t know maybe but certainly
[00:12:55] the in your lifetimes the battle between
[00:12:57] the US and China for knowledge Supremacy
[00:12:59] is going to be the big fight right so
[00:13:01] the US government banned essentially the
[00:13:02] Invidia chips although they weren&#39;t
[00:13:03] allowed to say that was what they were
[00:13:04] doing but they actually did that into
[00:13:05] China um they have about a 10year chip
[00:13:08] advant we have a roughly 10e chip
[00:13:09] advantage in terms of subdv is sub five
[00:13:12] roughly 10 years wow um and so you&#39;re
[00:13:14] gonna have so an example would be today
[00:13:16] we&#39;re a couple of years ahead of China
[00:13:17] my guess is we&#39;ll get a few more years
[00:13:18] ahead of China and the Chinese are
[00:13:20] whopping mad about this it&#39;s like hugely
[00:13:21] upset about it so that&#39;s a big deal that
[00:13:23] was a decision made by the Trump
[00:13:24] Administration and furthered by the
[00:13:25] Biden Administration do you think that
[00:13:27] it&#39;s going to make that scale of
[00:13:28] investment I mean OB the chips act but
[00:13:29] beyond that build building a massive AI
[00:13:32] system so so as you know I I lead a an
[00:13:34] informal ad hoc non-legal group that&#39;s
[00:13:37] that&#39;s different from illegal exactly
[00:13:39] justar which includes all the usual
[00:13:41] which includes all The Usual Suspects
[00:13:43] yes and The Usual Suspects over the last
[00:13:44] year came up with basis of the reasoning
[00:13:46] that became the um uh uh the B
[00:13:49] administration&#39;s uh AI act which is the
[00:13:51] longest Presidential Directive in
[00:13:53] history you&#39;re talking the special
[00:13:53] competitive studies Pro no this is the
[00:13:55] actual the actual act from the executive
[00:13:58] office and there implementing the
[00:13:59] details so far they&#39;ve got it right and
[00:14:01] so for example one of the debates that
[00:14:02] we had for last year has been how do you
[00:14:05] detect danger in a system which has
[00:14:07] learned it but you don&#39;t know what to
[00:14:09] ask it okay so in other words it&#39;s a
[00:14:11] core it&#39;s a sort of a core problem it&#39;s
[00:14:12] learned something bad but it can&#39;t tell
[00:14:14] you what it learned and you don&#39;t know
[00:14:15] what to ask it and there&#39;s so many
[00:14:16] threats right like it learned how to mix
[00:14:18] chemistry in some new way but you don&#39;t
[00:14:19] know how to ask it and so people are
[00:14:21] working hard on that but we ultimately
[00:14:22] wrote in our memos to them that there
[00:14:24] was a threshold which we arbitrarily
[00:14:25] named as 10 to the 26 flops which
[00:14:27] technically is a measure of computation
[00:14:29] that that threshold you had to report to
[00:14:31] the government that you were doing this
[00:14:32] and that&#39;s part of the rule the EU to
[00:14:35] just make sure they were different did
[00:14:36] 10 to 25 yeah but it&#39;s all kind of close
[00:14:38] enough I think all of these distinctions
[00:14:39] go away because the technology will now
[00:14:41] the technical term is called Federated
[00:14:42] training where basically you can take
[00:14:43] pieces and Union them together so we may
[00:14:46] not be able to keep keep people safe
[00:14:48] from these new things well rumors are
[00:14:49] that that&#39;s how open ey has had to train
[00:14:50] partly because of the power uh
[00:14:51] consumption there&#39;s no one place where
[00:14:53] so this is interesting I haven&#39;t heard
[00:14:55] that specific terminology before so he&#39;s
[00:14:57] saying that you can kind of build
[00:14:58] different pie pieces of LMS or sort of
[00:15:00] AI systems you train those pieces
[00:15:02] separately and then you Union them
[00:15:05] together you glue them together we&#39;ve
[00:15:06] seen this with the recent paper
[00:15:08] published where you can take sort of the
[00:15:09] large smart model and a very like a
[00:15:11] cheaper faster model and have sort of
[00:15:14] another sort of gatekeeper another yet
[00:15:16] another a model that kind of chooses
[00:15:17] where it routes the questions to so
[00:15:20] certain questions need to be answered by
[00:15:21] the bigger model but there&#39;s a lot that
[00:15:23] can be answered just as effectively by
[00:15:26] the smaller model and so this model just
[00:15:27] routes them to the cheaper model when
[00:15:29] needed and the results have been
[00:15:31] astonishing because it&#39;s if I remember
[00:15:33] my numbers correctly it has shown in
[00:15:35] some cases to reduce the cost of running
[00:15:37] these things by 80% while maintaining
[00:15:40] something like 96% accuracy so for just
[00:15:43] and I don&#39;t recall those the exact
[00:15:45] numbers but it was some big big numbers
[00:15:46] like that so it&#39;s a tiny reduction in
[00:15:48] accuracy for a potentially massive
[00:15:51] reduction in cost so I&#39;m not sure if
[00:15:53] that&#39;s an example of specifically what
[00:15:55] he&#39;s talking about but this idea of
[00:15:56] Federated training sounds like it&#39;s
[00:15:58] training piece in individual sort of
[00:16:00] batches right and taking those pieces
[00:16:02] and then putting them together to create
[00:16:04] the final model next they&#39;re talking
[00:16:06] about war well let&#39;s talk to about a
[00:16:08] real war that&#39;s going on I know that uh
[00:16:10] something you&#39;ve been very involved in
[00:16:11] is uh the Ukraine war and in particular
[00:16:15] uh I know that uh something you&#39;ve been
[00:16:17] very involved in is uh the Ukraine war
[00:16:19] and in particular uh I how you talk
[00:16:21] about white stor and your your goal of
[00:16:23] having a 500,000 $500 drones destroy $5
[00:16:26] million tanks so Howes that changing
[00:16:28] Warfare I work for the Secretary of
[00:16:29] Defense for seven years and and tried to
[00:16:32] change the way we run our military I&#39;m
[00:16:34] I&#39;m not a particularly big fan of the
[00:16:35] military but it&#39;s very expensive and I
[00:16:36] wanted to see if I could be helpful and
[00:16:37] I think in my view I largely failed they
[00:16:38] gave me a medal so they must give medals
[00:16:41] to failure or you know whatever but my
[00:16:43] self-criticism was nothing has really
[00:16:44] changed and the system in America is not
[00:16:47] going to lead to real Innovation so
[00:16:49] watching the Russians use tanks to
[00:16:51] destroy apartment buildings with little
[00:16:52] old ladies and kids just drove me crazy
[00:16:54] so I decided to work on a company with
[00:16:55] your friend Sebastian thrun and as a
[00:16:57] former faculty member here and a bunch
[00:16:59] of Stanford people and the idea
[00:17:01] basically is to do two things use AI in
[00:17:03] complicated powerful ways for these
[00:17:04] essentially robotic War and the second
[00:17:06] one is to lower the cost of the robots
[00:17:07] now you sit there and you go why would a
[00:17:09] good liberal like me do that and the
[00:17:10] answer is that the whole theory of
[00:17:13] armies is tanks artilleries and Mort and
[00:17:15] we can eliminate all of them and we can
[00:17:17] make the penalty for invading a country
[00:17:18] at least by lamb essentially being
[00:17:20] impossible it should eliminate the kind
[00:17:22] of land battles well this this is Rel
[00:17:23] question is that does it give more of
[00:17:25] advantage to defense versus offense can
[00:17:26] you can you even make that distinction
[00:17:27] because I&#39;ve been doing this for the
[00:17:28] last year I&#39;ve learned a lot about war
[00:17:29] that I really did not want to know and
[00:17:31] one of the things to know about war is
[00:17:32] that the offense always has the
[00:17:33] advantage because you can always
[00:17:35] overwhelm the defensive systems and so
[00:17:37] you&#39;re better off as a strategy of
[00:17:38] National Defense to have a very strong
[00:17:40] offense that you can use if you need to
[00:17:42] and the systems that I and others are
[00:17:43] building will do that um because of the
[00:17:45] way the system works I now a licensed I
[00:17:47] think he might have misspoken there let
[00:17:48] me know in the comments if you think so
[00:17:50] too or I&#39;m missing something I think he
[00:17:52] meant to say that he will he and others
[00:17:54] like him will build incredible defensive
[00:17:57] systems to reduce the effectiveness of
[00:17:59] invading and using offensive systems
[00:18:01] that&#39;s how I&#39;m interpreting I think he
[00:18:03] kind of to me it sounds like he misspoke
[00:18:04] a little bit if if I understand
[00:18:05] correctly because of the way the system
[00:18:07] works I am now a licensed arms deer
[00:18:10] others are building we do that um
[00:18:11] because of the way the system works I am
[00:18:13] now a licensed arms dealer so computer
[00:18:15] scientist businessman arms dealer and
[00:18:19] I&#39;m sorry to agression I I don&#39;t know I
[00:18:21] do not recommend this in your Carew I
[00:18:22] stick with they are um and because of
[00:18:24] the way the laws work um we&#39;re doing
[00:18:25] this privately and then it&#39;s this is all
[00:18:27] legal with the support of the
[00:18:28] governments it goes straight into
[00:18:28] Ukraine and then they fight the war and
[00:18:30] and and without going into all the
[00:18:31] details things are pretty bad I think if
[00:18:33] in May or June if the Russians build up
[00:18:36] as they expecting to Ukraine will lose a
[00:18:38] whole chunk of its territory and will
[00:18:39] begin the process of losing the whole
[00:18:40] country so I believe this was recorded
[00:18:42] in August 2024 just a few days ago or at
[00:18:45] least that&#39;s when it was posted if you
[00:18:47] recall the news headlines about it all
[00:18:49] of them are from like a few hours ago so
[00:18:51] I think he&#39;s talking about 2025 I&#39;m
[00:18:54] assuming so he&#39;s talking about May or
[00:18:55] June of 2025 for most of History humans
[00:18:58] sort of had a mystical understanding of
[00:18:59] the universe and then there&#39;s the
[00:19:00] Scientific Revolution and the
[00:19:01] enlightenment um and in your article you
[00:19:03] argue that now these models are becoming
[00:19:05] so complicated and uh difficult to
[00:19:08] understand that we don&#39;t really know
[00:19:09] what&#39;s going on in them I&#39;ll take a
[00:19:11] quote from Richard fean he says what I
[00:19:12] cannot create I do not understand I saw
[00:19:13] this quote the other day but now people
[00:19:15] are creating things they do not that
[00:19:16] that they can create but they don&#39;t
[00:19:16] really understand what&#39;s inside of them
[00:19:17] is the nature of knowledge changing in a
[00:19:19] way are we gonna have to start just
[00:19:20] taking the word for these models without
[00:19:22] them able being able to explain it to us
[00:19:23] the analogy I would offer is to
[00:19:24] teenagers if you have a teenager you
[00:19:26] know that they&#39;re human but you can&#39;t
[00:19:27] quite figure out what they&#39;re thinking
[00:19:29] um but somehow we&#39;ve managed in society
[00:19:30] to adapt to the presence of teenagers
[00:19:32] right and they eventually grow out of
[00:19:33] that and this serious so it&#39;s probably
[00:19:35] the case we&#39;re going to have knowledge
[00:19:37] systems that we cannot fully
[00:19:38] characterize but we understand their
[00:19:40] boundaries right we understand the
[00:19:42] limits of what they can do and that&#39;s
[00:19:43] probably the best outcome we can get do
[00:19:44] you think we&#39;ll understand the limits we
[00:19:46] we&#39;ll get pretty good at it the
[00:19:47] consensus of my group that meets on
[00:19:49] every week is that eventually the way
[00:19:51] you&#39;ll do this it&#39;s called SOC called
[00:19:52] adversarial AI is that there will there
[00:19:54] will actually be companies that you will
[00:19:56] hire and pay money to to break your AI
[00:19:58] system so it&#39;ll be the r instead of
[00:19:59] human red teams which is what they do
[00:20:00] today you&#39;ll have whole companies and a
[00:20:02] whole industry of AI systems whose jobs
[00:20:04] are to break the existing AI systems and
[00:20:05] find their vulnerabilities especially
[00:20:07] the knowledge that they have that we
[00:20:08] can&#39;t figure out that makes sense to me
[00:20:09] it&#39;s also a great project for you here
[00:20:11] at Stanford because if you have a
[00:20:12] graduate student who has to figure out
[00:20:13] how to attack one of these large models
[00:20:15] and understand what it does that is a
[00:20:16] great skill to build the Next Generation
[00:20:18] so it makes sense to me that the two
[00:20:19] will travel together if that&#39;s something
[00:20:21] that interests you there&#39;s a Twitter SLX
[00:20:23] account Pini The prompter Who uh
[00:20:25] basically jailbreaks a lot of these
[00:20:27] models usually within a few days of
[00:20:28] their release so he&#39;s just of course one
[00:20:30] of uh many people that do sort of things
[00:20:33] like that he does it kind of simly for
[00:20:35] entertainment and for online media
[00:20:38] Clouts but if you think about it third
[00:20:40] party testing third party red teaming of
[00:20:43] AI models third party quality assurance
[00:20:45] right QA of these models as they roll
[00:20:48] out and have contact with consumers with
[00:20:50] businesses with organizations Etc as
[00:20:52] well as just with various infrastructure
[00:20:54] systems and factories automations Etc
[00:20:57] war of course that&#39;s going to be a Big
[00:20:58] Industry that doesn&#39;t really exist yet
[00:21:01] it it just is beginning to grow and yet
[00:21:04] that might be something interesting and
[00:21:06] profitable to get into if that&#39;s uh
[00:21:08] that&#39;s your cup of tea next he comments
[00:21:10] just a bit on adver serial AI you just
[00:21:13] mentioned adversarial I&#39;m wonder if
[00:21:15] elaborate on that more it seems to be
[00:21:16] besides obviously increase get more
[00:21:18] perform mod getting them to do what you
[00:21:20] want
[00:21:22] isue well you have to assume that the
[00:21:24] current hallucination problems become
[00:21:26] less right in as the technology gets
[00:21:28] better and so forth I&#39;m not suggesting
[00:21:29] it goes away and then you also have to
[00:21:31] assume that there are tests for efficacy
[00:21:33] so there has to be a way of knowing that
[00:21:34] the thing succeeded so in the example
[00:21:36] that I gave of the Tik Tok competitor
[00:21:37] and by the way I was not arguing that
[00:21:38] you should illegally steal everybody&#39;s
[00:21:39] music what you would do if you&#39;re a
[00:21:40] silicon value entrepreneur which
[00:21:41] hopefully all of you will be is if it
[00:21:43] took off then you&#39;d hire a whole bunch
[00:21:44] of lawyers to go clean the mess up right
[00:21:45] but if if nobody uses your product it
[00:21:47] doesn&#39;t matter that you stole all the
[00:21:48] content and do not quote me right right
[00:21:51] you&#39;re on camera that&#39;s right but you
[00:21:53] see my point in other words Silicon
[00:21:54] Valley will run these tests and clean up
[00:21:55] the mess and that&#39;s typically how those
[00:21:56] things are done so so my own View is
[00:21:58] that you&#39;ll see more and more um
[00:22:00] performative systems with even better
[00:22:02] test and eventually adversarial tests
[00:22:03] and that&#39;ll keep it within a box the
[00:22:05] technical term is called Chain of
[00:22:06] Thought reasoning and people believe
[00:22:07] that in the next few years you&#39;ll be
[00:22:09] able to generate a thousand steps of
[00:22:10] Chain of Thought reasoning right do this
[00:22:12] do this it&#39;s like building recipes right
[00:22:13] that the recipes you can run the recipe
[00:22:15] and you can actually test that It
[00:22:16] produced the correct outcome and that&#39;s
[00:22:17] how the system will work next they ask
[00:22:19] what&#39;s going to be driving AI progress
[00:22:20] is it more data more compute is it just
[00:22:23] like chips and Hardware the amounts of
[00:22:24] money being thrown around are
[00:22:26] mindboggling and um I&#39;ve chose I
[00:22:29] essentially invest in everything because
[00:22:30] I can&#39;t figure out who&#39;s going to win
[00:22:31] and the amounts of money that are
[00:22:33] following me are so large I think some
[00:22:35] of it is because the early money has
[00:22:36] been made and the big money people who
[00:22:37] don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing have to
[00:22:38] have an AI component and everything is
[00:22:40] now an AI investment so they can&#39;t tell
[00:22:41] the difference I Define ai as Learning
[00:22:43] Systems systems that actually learn so I
[00:22:44] think that&#39;s one of them the second is
[00:22:46] that there are very sophisticated new
[00:22:47] algorithms that are sort of post
[00:22:48] Transformers my friend my collaborator
[00:22:50] for a long time has invented a new non-
[00:22:51] Transformer architecture there&#39;s a group
[00:22:53] that I&#39;m funding in Paris that has
[00:22:54] claims to done the same thing so there&#39;s
[00:22:56] enormous invention there a lot of things
[00:22:57] at Stanford and the final thing is that
[00:22:59] there is a belief in the market that the
[00:23:01] invention of intelligence has infinite
[00:23:03] return so let&#39;s say you have you put $50
[00:23:05] billion of capital into a company you
[00:23:07] have to make an awful lot of money from
[00:23:08] intelligence to pay that back I mean
[00:23:10] when you phrase it like that it seems to
[00:23:11] make sense if you invent intelligence
[00:23:14] certainly that would have an infinite
[00:23:17] return so it&#39;s probably the case that
[00:23:18] we&#39;ll go through some huge investment
[00:23:20] bubble and then it&#39;ll sort itself out
[00:23:21] that&#39;s always been true in the past and
[00:23:23] it&#39;s likely to be true here and what you
[00:23:24] said earlier was you think that the
[00:23:26] leaders are pulling away from right now
[00:23:27] right now and and
[00:23:29] this is a really the question is roughly
[00:23:31] the following there&#39;s a company called
[00:23:32] mrr in France they done a really good
[00:23:34] job um and I&#39;m obviously an investor um
[00:23:36] they have produced their second version
[00:23:38] their third model is likely to be closed
[00:23:39] because it&#39;s so expensive they need
[00:23:41] revenue and they can&#39;t give their model
[00:23:42] away so this open source versus closed
[00:23:44] Source debate in our industry is huge
[00:23:46] and um my entire career was based on
[00:23:49] people being willing to share software
[00:23:50] in open source everything about me is
[00:23:52] open source much of Google&#39;s
[00:23:53] underpinnings were open source
[00:23:54] everything I&#39;ve done technically and yet
[00:23:56] it may be that the capital costs which
[00:23:57] are so immense fundamentally changes how
[00:23:59] software is built you and I were talking
[00:24:01] um my own view of software programmers
[00:24:03] is that software programmers
[00:24:04] productivity will at least double there
[00:24:05] are three or four software companies
[00:24:07] that are trying to do that I&#39;ve invested
[00:24:08] in all of them in and they&#39;re all trying
[00:24:10] to make software programmers more
[00:24:11] productive the most interesting one that
[00:24:12] I just met with is called augment and I
[00:24:14] always think of an individual programmer
[00:24:15] and they said that&#39;s not our Target our
[00:24:16] Target are these 100 person software
[00:24:17] programming teams on millions of lines
[00:24:19] of code where nobody knows what&#39;s going
[00:24:20] on that&#39;s a really good AI thing will
[00:24:22] they make money I hope so you mentioned
[00:24:24] that there&#39;s the combination of the
[00:24:25] context exension the agents and the text
[00:24:27] to action is going to unimaginable
[00:24:29] impacts first of all why is the
[00:24:31] combination important and second of all
[00:24:32] I know that you know you&#39;re not like a
[00:24:33] crystal ball and you can&#39;t necessarily
[00:24:35] tell the future but why do you think
[00:24:36] it&#39;s beyond anything that we could
[00:24:37] imagine I think largely because the
[00:24:38] context window allows you to solve the
[00:24:40] problem of recency the current models
[00:24:42] take a year to train roughly six six
[00:24:44] there 18 months six months of
[00:24:45] preparation six months of training six
[00:24:46] months of fine tuning so they&#39;re always
[00:24:47] out of date context window you can feed
[00:24:50] what happened like you can ask it
[00:24:51] questions about the uh the Hamas Israel
[00:24:53] war right in a context that&#39;s very
[00:24:55] powerful it becomes current like Google
[00:24:56] um in the case of Agents I&#39;ll give you
[00:24:58] an example I set up a foundation which
[00:24:59] is funding a nonprofit which starts
[00:25:01] there&#39;s a I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s
[00:25:02] Chemists in the room that I don&#39;t really
[00:25:03] understand chemistry there&#39;s a a tool
[00:25:05] called chro CW which was an LM based
[00:25:08] system that learned chemistry and what
[00:25:09] they do is they run it to generate
[00:25:10] chemistry hypotheses about proteins and
[00:25:12] they have a lab which runs the tests
[00:25:14] overnight and then it learns that&#39;s a
[00:25:16] huge acceleration accelerant in
[00:25:17] chemistry Material Science and so forth
[00:25:19] so that&#39;s that&#39;s an agent model and I
[00:25:21] think the text to action can be
[00:25:21] understood by just having a lot of sheet
[00:25:23] programmers right um and I don&#39;t think
[00:25:25] we understand what happens and this is
[00:25:26] again your area of expertise what happen
[00:25:28] happens when everyone has their own
[00:25:29] programmer I&#39;m not talking about turning
[00:25:30] on and off the lights you know I imagine
[00:25:32] another example um for some reason you
[00:25:34] don&#39;t like Google so you say build me a
[00:25:35] Google competitor yeah you personally
[00:25:37] you don&#39;t build me a Google competitor
[00:25:38] uh search the web build a UI make a good
[00:25:41] copy um add generative AI in an
[00:25:43] interesting way do it in 30 seconds and
[00:25:45] see if it works right so a lot of people
[00:25:49] believe that the incumbents including
[00:25:50] Google are vulnerable to this kind of an
[00:25:52] attack now we&#39;ll see there were a bunch
[00:25:53] of questions who were sent over by
[00:25:54] slider I want to give some of them
[00:25:55] upload so um here&#39;s one um we talked a
[00:25:57] little about this last year um how can
[00:25:58] we stop AI from influencing public
[00:25:59] opinion misinformation especially during
[00:26:00] the upcoming he&#39;s asked a bit about
[00:26:02] misinformation how can we prevent AI
[00:26:05] from causing misinformation he talks
[00:26:07] about how during his time working with
[00:26:08] YouTube that was a problem people would
[00:26:10] upload a video for profit for their own
[00:26:13] self-gain and as a result of
[00:26:15] misinformation he says well people could
[00:26:17] be hurt he even says people die so
[00:26:19] certainly that is a problem if you saw
[00:26:22] my yesterday&#39;s video about grock 2 and
[00:26:24] the images it generates they&#39;re very re
[00:26:26] looking and grock 2 does not seem to
[00:26:29] have any sort of safety rails in place
[00:26:31] it just generates whatever you ask for
[00:26:33] so heading into the selection certainly
[00:26:35] that could be an issue he talks a little
[00:26:37] bit about some sort of a digital
[00:26:38] authentication or a public key
[00:26:40] authentication basically if somebody
[00:26:42] like the president speaks there&#39;s some
[00:26:44] key that everybody else can verify
[00:26:46] saying okay this is him this is his
[00:26:48] original audio he mentions briefly that
[00:26:50] it&#39;s it seems like he&#39;s saying it&#39;s a
[00:26:51] shame that the American universities
[00:26:53] aren&#39;t getting as much resources for
[00:26:56] computes for Google cloud and other
[00:26:58] places like that and this explosion
[00:27:00] where all the big companies are
[00:27:01] basically gobbling up the available
[00:27:03] resources and so he&#39;s saying the right
[00:27:05] thing for us to do is to get them the
[00:27:07] resources they need to give the
[00:27:08] universities the compute the resources
[00:27:10] that they need to pursue research and
[00:27:12] development and all that stuff next they
[00:27:13] talk about automation who&#39;s getting
[00:27:15] replaced who&#39;s getting to be obsolete in
[00:27:18] the labor force so let&#39;s take a look at
[00:27:20] that really fast I&#39;ll defer to the real
[00:27:22] expert here uh as your amateur Economist
[00:27:24] taught by Eric um I I fundamentally
[00:27:27] believe that the the sort of college
[00:27:28] education High skills task will be fine
[00:27:30] because people will work with these
[00:27:31] systems I think the systems is no
[00:27:33] different from any other technology wave
[00:27:34] the dangerous jobs and the jobs which
[00:27:35] require very little human judgment will
[00:27:37] get replaced the next question is kind
[00:27:39] of like the global balance of AI power
[00:27:42] so the person asking the question
[00:27:43] specifically mentions us and China but
[00:27:46] as you see here Eric specifically
[00:27:48] focuses on India take a listen the most
[00:27:50] interesting country is India because the
[00:27:52] top AI people come from India to the us
[00:27:54] and we should let India keep some of its
[00:27:56] top talent not all of them but some of
[00:27:57] them um and they don&#39;t have the kind of
[00:27:58] training facilities and programs that we
[00:28:00] so richly have here to me India is the
[00:28:01] big swing state in that regard China&#39;s
[00:28:03] Lost it&#39;s not going to not going to come
[00:28:04] back they&#39;re not going to change the
[00:28:05] regime as much as people wish them to do
[00:28:07] Japan and Korea are clearly in our camp
[00:28:09] Taiwan is a fantastic country whose
[00:28:11] software is terrible so that&#39;s not gonna
[00:28:12] going to work um amazing hard and in the
[00:28:15] rest of the world there are not a lot of
[00:28:16] other good choices that are big German
[00:28:18] the Europe is screwed up because of
[00:28:19] Brussels it&#39;s not a new fact I spent 10
[00:28:20] years fighting them and I work really
[00:28:22] hard to get them to fix the the EU act
[00:28:24] and they still have all the restrictions
[00:28:26] that make it very difficult to do our
[00:28:27] kind of research in Europe my French
[00:28:28] friends have spent all their time
[00:28:29] battling Brussels and mcon who&#39;s a
[00:28:31] personal friend is fighting hard for
[00:28:33] this and so France I think has a chance
[00:28:34] I don&#39;t see I don&#39;t see Germany coming
[00:28:35] and the rest is not big
[00:28:36] enough yes ma&#39;am so I know you&#39;re an
[00:28:39] engineer by
[00:28:40] trainer um given the capabilities that
[00:28:43] you Enis these mod should we still spend
[00:28:44] Hing to yeah because because ultimately
[00:28:46] it&#39;s it&#39;s the old thing of why do you
[00:28:47] study English if you can speak English
[00:28:49] you get better at it right you really do
[00:28:50] need to understand how these systems
[00:28:51] work and I feel very strong yes sir yeah
[00:28:53] I&#39;m curious if you explore good answer
[00:28:55] distributed setting and I&#39;m asking
[00:28:56] because sure like making a large cluster
[00:28:58] but Ma are powerful there&#39;s a lot of
[00:28:59] small maches across the world so like
[00:29:01] you think like folding at home are a
[00:29:02] similar idea works for training yeah we
[00:29:04] look very hard this so the way the
[00:29:06] algorithms work is you have a very large
[00:29:07] Matrix and you have essentially a
[00:29:08] multiplication function so think of it
[00:29:10] as going back and forth and back and
[00:29:12] forth and these systems are completely
[00:29:13] limited by the speed of memory to CPU or
[00:29:15] GPU and in fact the next iteration of
[00:29:18] Nvidia chips has combined all those
[00:29:20] functions into one chip the chips are
[00:29:21] now so big that they glue them all
[00:29:22] together and in fact the package is so
[00:29:24] sensitive the package is put together in
[00:29:26] a clean room as well as the chip itself
[00:29:27] so the looks like supercomputers and
[00:29:29] speed of light especially memory
[00:29:31] interconnect really dominated so I think
[00:29:32] unlikely for a while is there a way to
[00:29:33] segment the element like so Jeff de last
[00:29:35] year when he spoke here talked about
[00:29:36] having these different parts of it you
[00:29:38] train separately and then kind of
[00:29:39] Federate them each you know in order to
[00:29:41] do that you&#39;d have to have 10 million
[00:29:42] such things and then you&#39;re the way you
[00:29:44] ask the questions would be too slow he&#39;s
[00:29:45] talking about eight or 10 12 not at Lev
[00:29:49] the back way back I know like after
[00:29:51] releas new yor time open using work for
[00:29:53] training do you think
[00:29:54] that&#39;s I used to do a lot of work on the
[00:29:56] music licensing stuff what I learned was
[00:29:58] that in the 60s there was a series of
[00:30:00] lawsuits that resulted in an agreement
[00:30:02] where you get a a stipulated royalty
[00:30:04] whenever your song is played even even
[00:30:06] they don&#39;t even know who you are so paid
[00:30:07] into a bank and my guess is it&#39;ll be the
[00:30:08] same thing there be lots of lawsuits and
[00:30:09] there&#39;ll be some kind of stipulated
[00:30:10] agreement which will just say you have
[00:30:12] to pay x per of whatever Revenue you
[00:30:14] have in order to use pass cap BMI cap
[00:30:16] BMI look them up it&#39;s long it will seem
[00:30:17] very old to you but I think that&#39;s how
[00:30:18] it will yes sir interesting like there&#39;s
[00:30:21] a few players that are dominating AI
[00:30:23] right they&#39;ll continue to dominate and
[00:30:24] they seem to overlap with the large
[00:30:25] companies that all the antitrust
[00:30:27] regulation is kind of focus on how do
[00:30:28] you see those two Trends kind of yeah
[00:30:30] like do you see Regulators breaking up
[00:30:31] these companies and how will that affect
[00:30:33] the yeah so in my career I helped
[00:30:36] Microsoft get broken up and it wasn&#39;t
[00:30:37] broken up and I fought fought for Google
[00:30:39] to not be broken up and it&#39;s not been
[00:30:40] broken up so it sure looks to me like
[00:30:41] the trend is not to be broken up um as
[00:30:43] long as the companies avoid being John D
[00:30:45] Rockefeller the senior and I studied
[00:30:46] this looked it up it&#39;s how antitrust law
[00:30:48] came I don&#39;t think the government is
[00:30:49] will act the re the reason you&#39;re seeing
[00:30:51] these large companies dominate is who
[00:30:52] has the capital to build these data
[00:30:54] centers right right so my friend Reed
[00:30:56] and my friend com
[00:30:58] two have we talked to you about the
[00:31:00] decision that they made to take
[00:31:01] inflection so I believe Mustafa he&#39;s
[00:31:02] talking about Mustafa siman who is the
[00:31:04] co-founder of Google Deep Mind friend
[00:31:06] Reed and my friend M coming next we two
[00:31:08] week have Reed talked to you about the
[00:31:10] decision that they made to take
[00:31:11] inflection and essentially PE part it
[00:31:12] into Microsoft basically they decided
[00:31:14] they couldn&#39;t raise the tens of billions
[00:31:15] of dollars is that number public that
[00:31:16] you mentioned earlier have
[00:31:18] have
[00:31:20] got we want
[00:31:24] this I was wondering where all this is
[00:31:26] going to leave countries where in b
[00:31:27] ipants in phun models and access to
[00:31:30] compu the rich get richer and the poor
[00:31:32] do the best they can um they&#39;ll have to
[00:31:34] the fact of the matter is this is a rich
[00:31:36] country&#39;s game right huge Capital lots
[00:31:38] of technically strong people strong
[00:31:39] government support right there are two
[00:31:41] examples there lots of other countries
[00:31:43] that have all sorts of problems they
[00:31:43] don&#39;t have those resources they&#39;ll have
[00:31:44] to find a partner they&#39;ll have to join
[00:31:46] with somebody else something like that I
[00:31:48] last we met you he&#39;s fairly blunt he&#39;s
[00:31:50] fairly straightforward he I think kind
[00:31:52] of calls it how he sees it and it really
[00:31:55] seems like he&#39;s not talking one side or
[00:31:56] the other he doesn&#39;t have he&#39;s not
[00:31:58] pumping his back so to speak so he&#39;s not
[00:32:00] saying the things that benefit his
[00:32:01] portfolio or whatever he&#39;s just like
[00:32:03] yeah this is how it&#39;s going to be this
[00:32:04] is how it works by default big companies
[00:32:06] are not going to broken up the rich get
[00:32:07] richer Etc and finally he&#39;s asked a
[00:32:10] little bit more about kind of the
[00:32:11] business and entrepreneur side of things
[00:32:13] if you&#39;re starting your own company you
[00:32:15] have a product idea what does that look
[00:32:16] like how do you develop it how do you
[00:32:18] create a lot of wealth with your own
[00:32:20] product here&#39;s his answer I want I think
[00:32:23] the last we met you you at hackathon at
[00:32:24] AGI house and I know you spent a lot of
[00:32:26] time helping like young people as they
[00:32:27] create a lot of wealth and you spoke
[00:32:28] very passionately about about wanting to
[00:32:30] to do that do you have any advice for
[00:32:31] folks here as they&#39;re building their
[00:32:32] they&#39;re writing their business PL for
[00:32:33] this class or policy proposals or
[00:32:34] research proposals um you know at this
[00:32:36] stage of the careers going forward well
[00:32:39] um I teach a class in the business
[00:32:40] school on this so you should come to my
[00:32:41] class um the I am struck by the speed
[00:32:44] which with which you can build
[00:32:46] demonstrations of new ideas so in that
[00:32:49] in one of the hack I did the winning
[00:32:51] team the command was fly the Drone
[00:32:53] between two towers and it was given a
[00:32:54] virtual drone space and it figured out
[00:32:56] how to fly the Drone what the word
[00:32:57] between them generated the code in
[00:32:58] Python and flew the Drone in the
[00:32:59] simulator through the tower I just it
[00:33:01] would have taken a week or two you know
[00:33:03] good professional programmers to do that
[00:33:05] um I&#39;m telling you that the ability to
[00:33:06] prototype quickly really you know part
[00:33:08] part of the problem being an
[00:33:09] entrepreneur is everything happens
[00:33:10] faster well now if you can&#39;t get your
[00:33:12] prototype built in a day using these
[00:33:14] various tools you need to think about
[00:33:16] that right because that&#39;s who your
[00:33:17] competitor is doing so I guess my
[00:33:18] biggest advice is when you start
[00:33:19] thinking about a company is find the
[00:33:20] right a business CL plan in fact you
[00:33:22] should ask the computer to write your
[00:33:23] business plan for you
[00:33:25] um talk about that after leave it and
[00:33:28] and but I think it&#39;s very important to
[00:33:30] prototype your idea using these tools as
[00:33:32] quickly as you can because you can be
[00:33:33] sure there&#39;s another person doing
[00:33:34] exactly that same thing in another
[00:33:36] company in another University in a place
[00:33:38] that You&#39; all right
[00:33:40] thank very cool so this piece was uh
[00:33:43] taken down so apparently it&#39;s not even
[00:33:44] online right now but hopefully those few
[00:33:47] little Clips give you glips about what
[00:33:49] he thinks of AI you know I&#39;ve kind of
[00:33:51] cut out all the pieces that I think
[00:33:53] caused the controversy or whatever that
[00:33:55] situation was I don&#39;t think it really
[00:33:56] had anything to do with AI or anything
[00:33:58] of of substance I mean maybe touched on
[00:34:01] some political issues but whatever this
[00:34:03] is a person with a lot of really
[00:34:05] technical background and even though
[00:34:07] he&#39;s more of like a business guy he is
[00:34:10] spoken of with a lot of respect by all
[00:34:12] the engineers and all the very highly
[00:34:14] technical people in the Bay Area in the
[00:34:16] Silicon Valley he&#39;s somebody that really
[00:34:17] understands the tech space looks like
[00:34:19] Forbes has him listed as having a netw
[00:34:21] worth of almost $24 billion he&#39;s good
[00:34:25] friends he said with Sam Alman president
[00:34:27] of France France sounds like he knows
[00:34:29] all the co-founders of various AI
[00:34:31] companies big and small I mean this is
[00:34:33] somebody that&#39;s very very on the inside
[00:34:35] this is somebody that knows where things
[00:34:37] are going so certainly when he says
[00:34:39] something I tend to listen I put a great
[00:34:41] deal of weight into what he&#39;s saying and
[00:34:43] what he&#39;s saying is this AI wave is just
[00:34:47] starting we have two massive countries
[00:34:49] two big countries with the capital and
[00:34:50] the talent and everything else that&#39;s
[00:34:52] needed that are vying for AI Supremacy
[00:34:54] the issues with the chips and the power
[00:34:56] and the data while those are bottlenecks
[00:34:59] it seems like they will slowly be
[00:35:01] perhaps even maybe not that slowly
[00:35:03] slowly but but be improved you mentioned
[00:35:05] building data centers and various other
[00:35:07] AI infrastructure in Canada potentially
[00:35:10] which makes a lot of sense if you think
[00:35:12] about it lots of open land tends to be
[00:35:14] colder which again you know Heating and
[00:35:17] the generation of heat and having to
[00:35:19] cool these facilities is a concern tons
[00:35:22] land very friendly government to the US
[00:35:24] you know in factorio how do you just
[00:35:26] like find a big chunk of the map where
[00:35:28] there&#39;s a lot of open land and you&#39;d
[00:35:30] build all your nuclear power plants
[00:35:32] you&#39;d build out your entire like
[00:35:34] electricity infrastructure there just
[00:35:36] have a cable going back to where you
[00:35:38] need electricity to be it begs the
[00:35:40] question is this the future of Canada
[00:35:42] I&#39;m only kidding of course folks but the
[00:35:45] more and more I think about it there is
[00:35:46] a lot of land it&#39;s close by and it&#39;s
[00:35:49] cold and certainly that would be
[00:35:51] phenomenal for the revenue of Canada to
[00:35:53] generate some sort of tax some sort of
[00:35:55] Revenue based on right one of the kind
[00:35:57] of superpowers building out the
[00:35:59] infrastructure it needs to stay dominant
[00:36:01] in the AI race right I mean they&#39;re
[00:36:03] talking about creating 100 billion doll
[00:36:06] data centers potentially even the
[00:36:08] estimates a size 300 billion so that&#39;s
[00:36:10] that&#39;s one company that&#39;s not even the
[00:36:12] US government supported projects that&#39;s
[00:36:15] just a publicly traded company doing
[00:36:17] that sounds like he&#39;s really believing
[00:36:19] in Nvidia and the power of Nvidia and
[00:36:21] it&#39;s Cuda sort of software that the
[00:36:24] chips run on and if I&#39;m understanding
[00:36:26] him correctly he&#39;s not really seeing any
[00:36:28] competition to that I mean there&#39;s some
[00:36:30] things in the Horizon maybe possibly but
[00:36:32] nothing yet so it sounds like a lot of
[00:36:35] this money like a lot of it will be
[00:36:36] flowing into Nvidia and of course this
[00:36:39] idea that as the context window expands
[00:36:41] it&#39;ll become more and more sort of
[00:36:44] similar to training in a sense that
[00:36:46] right if it takes a while to train up a
[00:36:47] model but it can do in context learning
[00:36:50] meaning that you&#39;re able to just upload
[00:36:51] books and stuff to the finished model
[00:36:53] it&#39;s able to learn from them which we&#39;ve
[00:36:54] seen that with Gemini they found a
[00:36:56] language that doesn&#39;t have an a lot of
[00:36:57] online presence only something like 24
[00:37:00] people in the world speak it but they
[00:37:01] have some notebooks and manuscripts and
[00:37:03] stuff like that they uploaded to gini
[00:37:05] the actual finished trained Gemini and
[00:37:08] that model was able to learn how to
[00:37:11] speak it how to create sentences in it
[00:37:13] it wasn&#39;t trained on it it would learned
[00:37:15] in context right so as the context
[00:37:18] window ramps up to 10 million tokens
[00:37:21] that certainly seems like it would
[00:37:22] change how we think about pre- and
[00:37:25] posttraining or in other words once the
[00:37:27] model is trained it doesn&#39;t stop
[00:37:29] learning if you wanted to learn about a
[00:37:31] specific thing that you wanted to learn
[00:37:33] about maybe it&#39;s you know you have a
[00:37:34] company or that that have millions of
[00:37:37] documents and procedures and stuff like
[00:37:39] that just kind of like everywhere but no
[00:37:41] one person understands all of it well in
[00:37:43] the past that was kind of useless it
[00:37:45] doesn&#39;t really help you but if you can
[00:37:47] upload it to a model like that all of a
[00:37:49] sudden it knows all those things about
[00:37:51] your company it can train people on it
[00:37:54] it can answer your questions it can kind
[00:37:55] of manage it update see if there&#39;s any
[00:37:58] conflicts anywhere in it so instead of
[00:38:00] training a brand new model on that you
[00:38:02] just use an existing model and upload
[00:38:04] that stuff into the 10 million token
[00:38:07] context window combine that with text to
[00:38:09] action which is another word I&#39;ve heard
[00:38:11] it before this phrase but it&#39;s not that
[00:38:14] often used I feel like but yeah I mean
[00:38:16] that&#39;s what agents are basically right
[00:38:18] it&#39;s text to action you type in impr
[00:38:21] prompt and it goes and does that action
[00:38:23] it does the thing you&#39;re asking it to do
[00:38:25] as they get better at long-term plan
[00:38:27] long-term reasoning and actually Deep
[00:38:29] Mind CEO de saabi is also just had an
[00:38:32] interview talking about something very
[00:38:34] very similar he&#39;s talking about this
[00:38:36] idea that as agents become better
[00:38:38] long-term reasoners and planners they
[00:38:40] will become better and better at
[00:38:42] carrying out those long Horizon tasks
[00:38:44] and he&#39;s saying we&#39;re not ready for it
[00:38:46] when everybody can have these qualified
[00:38:49] capable agents right he&#39;s saying it&#39;s
[00:38:51] going to have an impact on the world at
[00:38:53] a scale no one understands yet and that
[00:38:56] certainly I think is true that&#39;s
[00:38:58] certainly something that I fully agree
[00:39:00] with a lot of our social structures and
[00:39:03] stuff we&#39;re kind of used to will have to
[00:39:05] change and of course he&#39;s saying if
[00:39:06] you&#39;re worried about losing your job
[00:39:08] having a degree that&#39;s going to become
[00:39:09] worthless you know should you still
[00:39:11] learn to code he&#39;s saying business as
[00:39:13] usual there yes some easy simple jobs or
[00:39:16] maybe very dangerous jobs jobs where
[00:39:18] there&#39;s not a lot of hard decisions to
[00:39:20] be made yes those might go away and yes
[00:39:23] these AIS might be pretty good at coding
[00:39:25] creating projects but learning all those
[00:39:27] skills getting better at those skills
[00:39:28] learning how everything works that&#39;s
[00:39:30] that&#39;s not going out of fashion that&#39;s
[00:39:32] never going to just disappear his
[00:39:34] example was you know if you can speak
[00:39:36] English why would you learn English
[00:39:38] right why would you study English well
[00:39:40] it&#39;s to get better at it to improve your
[00:39:42] abilities with it so I hope you enjoyed
[00:39:44] that make sure you subscribed please
[00:39:46] give me a thumbs up if you enjoyed it my
[00:39:48] name is Wes rth and I&#39;ll see you next
[00:39:49] time thank you for watching
[00:00:00] Eric Schmidt gave a facety talk at
[00:00:02] Stanford just a few days ago about AI he
[00:00:05] was of course the former Google CEO and
[00:00:08] perceived by people as a bit of a
[00:00:10] futurist he&#39;s able to kind of often very
[00:00:12] accurately predict where technology is
[00:00:14] going the interview was over an hour
[00:00:16] long and it was fascinating covering
[00:00:18] topics like ai ai agents where this
[00:00:20] whole thing is going Etc and had a lot
[00:00:22] of pretty brilliant insights by Eric
[00:00:25] into where he believes this is going but
[00:00:28] unfortunately at our plus long interview
[00:00:30] there was just one comment that people
[00:00:32] didn&#39;t like the media machine went into
[00:00:35] overdrive mode and the video has been
[00:00:38] basically taken down it&#39;s no longer
[00:00:40] available to see it was deemed too hot
[00:00:43] for the internet and no longer available
[00:00:45] but just between you and me and keep
[00:00:48] this on the DL please I might have a
[00:00:51] copy of it maybe allegedly I feel like I
[00:00:54] need to say something here that reduces
[00:00:55] my liability some sort of a legal
[00:00:58] statement like I take no resp
[00:00:59] responsibility for my actions yeah that
[00:01:01] should do subscribe for more sweet AI
[00:01:03] content let&#39;s take a look at a few clips
[00:01:05] from this Stanford lecture by Eric
[00:01:08] Schmidt about AI I think you will like
[00:01:10] it if you do hit that thumbs up please
[00:01:13] because this is somebody that has a bit
[00:01:14] of a Clairvoyance about the future of
[00:01:16] tech he tends to see how things will
[00:01:18] unfold with startling accuracy so before
[00:01:21] he starts talking he asks the class to
[00:01:23] basically Define what a context window
[00:01:25] is and what AI agents are context
[00:01:28] Windows of course you can think of it as
[00:01:29] sort of a short-term memory it&#39;s
[00:01:31] basically the amount of words that a
[00:01:33] large language model can read and also
[00:01:36] write and output and kind of interact
[00:01:38] with right so if it has a large context
[00:01:40] window you can give it a whole book and
[00:01:42] then ask it questions about the book if
[00:01:44] it has a very short context window we
[00:01:46] might start answering a question and
[00:01:47] then halfway through forget what I was
[00:01:49] talking about it would be kind of a
[00:01:50] whoops I run out of memory type of thing
[00:01:52] and AI agents are things they can sort
[00:01:55] of complete tasks on your behalf you can
[00:01:56] tell them to go order something off of
[00:01:58] Amazon they&#39;ll go they&#39;ll search they&#39;ll
[00:02:00] do reviews they&#39;ll check the sizes the
[00:02:02] colors whatever and then order it and
[00:02:04] then report that they&#39;ve done it back to
[00:02:05] you so you can think of it as kind of a
[00:02:07] smart intern that&#39;s online that&#39;s Ai and
[00:02:10] Eric is talking about potentially a
[00:02:11] seeing a 10 million token context window
[00:02:15] sometime soon potentially in next two
[00:02:17] years or so he doesn&#39;t specify a
[00:02:19] timeline but soon so the first thing he
[00:02:21] talks about is what are we going to
[00:02:23] expect to happen in the next 2 to 5
[00:02:26] years so in the short term specifically
[00:02:29] at the intersection of something like a
[00:02:31] 10 million token context window and
[00:02:33] improving autonomous AI agents take a
[00:02:35] listen so an agent is something that
[00:02:37] does that does some kind of a task
[00:02:39] another definition would be that it&#39;s an
[00:02:40] LM State and memory okay can anybody
[00:02:44] again scientist can can any of you
[00:02:45] define text action taking text and
[00:02:47] turning into an action right here go
[00:02:48] ahead yes instead of taking text and
[00:02:50] turning it into more text more text
[00:02:52] taking text and have the AI trigger
[00:02:54] actions based so another definition
[00:02:56] would be language to python a pro
[00:02:59] programming language I never wanted to
[00:03:00] see survive and and everything in AI is
[00:03:02] being done in Python there&#39;s a new
[00:03:03] language called Mojo that has just come
[00:03:05] out which looks like they finally have
[00:03:06] addressed AI programming but we&#39;ll see
[00:03:07] if that actually survives over the
[00:03:08] dominance of python um one more
[00:03:10] technical question why is NVIDIA worth2
[00:03:12] trillion doll and the other companies
[00:03:14] are struggling technical answer I mean I
[00:03:16] think it just boils down to like most of
[00:03:17] code needs to run with C optimizations
[00:03:19] that currently only support so other
[00:03:21] companies can make whatever they want to
[00:03:22] but unless they have the 10 years of
[00:03:24] software there you don&#39;t have the
[00:03:25] machine learning optimization I like to
[00:03:27] think of Cuda as the C programming
[00:03:29] language for
[00:03:30] yeah right that&#39;s the way I like to
[00:03:31] think of it was founded in 2008 I always
[00:03:32] thought it was a terrible language and
[00:03:34] yet it&#39;s become dominant there&#39;s another
[00:03:35] Insight there&#39;s a set of Open Source
[00:03:36] libraries which are highly optimized to
[00:03:38] Cuda and not anything else and everybody
[00:03:39] who builds all these Stacks right this
[00:03:41] is completely missed in any of the
[00:03:42] discussions right the com it&#39;s
[00:03:44] technically called VM and a whole bunch
[00:03:45] of libraries like that highly optimized
[00:03:47] Cuda very hard to replicate that if
[00:03:48] you&#39;re a competitor so what does all
[00:03:50] this mean in the next year you&#39;re going
[00:03:52] to see very large context Windows agents
[00:03:56] and text action when they are delivered
[00:03:58] at scale it&#39;s going to have an impact on
[00:03:59] world at a scale that no one understands
[00:04:01] yet much bigger than the horrific impact
[00:04:03] we&#39;ve had on by social media right in my
[00:04:05] view so here&#39;s why in a context window
[00:04:07] you can basically use that as short-term
[00:04:08] memory and I was shocked that context
[00:04:11] Windows get this long the technical
[00:04:12] reasons have to do with the fact that
[00:04:13] it&#39;s hard to serve hard to calculate and
[00:04:14] so forth the interesting thing about
[00:04:15] short-term memory when you feed the you
[00:04:18] ask a question read 20 books you give it
[00:04:20] the text of the books is the query and
[00:04:22] you say tell me what they say it forgets
[00:04:23] the middle which is exactly how human
[00:04:25] brains work too right that&#39;s where we
[00:04:26] are with respect to agents there are
[00:04:28] people who are now building essentially
[00:04:30] llm agents and the way they do it is
[00:04:31] they read something like chemistry they
[00:04:33] discover the principles of chemistry and
[00:04:34] then they test it and then they add that
[00:04:36] back into their understanding right
[00:04:38] that&#39;s extremely powerful and then the
[00:04:40] third thing as I mentioned is text
[00:04:41] action so I&#39;ll give you an example the
[00:04:43] government is in the process of trying
[00:04:45] to ban Tik to we&#39;ll see if that actually
[00:04:46] happens if Tik Tok is banned here&#39;s what
[00:04:48] I propose each and every one of you do
[00:04:49] say to your L the foll make me a copy of
[00:04:53] Tik Tok steal all the users steal all
[00:04:55] the music put my preferences in it
[00:04:57] produce this program in the next 30
[00:04:59] seconds release it and in one hour if
[00:05:01] it&#39;s not viral do something different
[00:05:03] along the same lines that&#39;s the command
[00:05:05] boom boom boom boom right you understand
[00:05:08] how powerful that is if you could go
[00:05:09] from arbitrary language to arbitrary
[00:05:11] digital command which is essentially
[00:05:12] what python in this scenario is imagine
[00:05:14] that each and every human on the planet
[00:05:16] has their own programmer that actually
[00:05:18] does what they want as opposed to the
[00:05:18] programmers that work for me who don&#39;t
[00:05:20] do what I ask or potentially a whole
[00:05:22] Army of AI influencers each with its own
[00:05:25] little tweak that are completely managed
[00:05:28] by these AI agents trying to fill a
[00:05:30] certain Niche a certain Gap a certain
[00:05:32] personality type you can have an
[00:05:34] infinite amount of them boasting 24
[00:05:36] hours a day the programmers here know
[00:05:38] what I&#39;m talking about so imagine a non-
[00:05:39] arrogant programmer that actually does
[00:05:41] what you want and you don&#39;t have to pay
[00:05:42] all that money to and there&#39;s infinite
[00:05:44] supply of these program this is all
[00:05:45] within the next year or two very soon
[00:05:47] those three things and I&#39;m quite
[00:05:49] convinced it&#39;s the union of those three
[00:05:50] things that will happen in the next wave
[00:05:53] so you asked about what else is going to
[00:05:54] happen um every six months I oscillate
[00:05:57] so we&#39;re on a it&#39;s an even odd
[00:05:58] oscillation the moment the gap between
[00:06:01] the frontier models which they&#39;re now
[00:06:02] only three I&#39;ll ref few who they are and
[00:06:05] everybody else appears to me to be
[00:06:06] getting larger six months ago I was
[00:06:08] convinced that the Gap was getting
[00:06:09] smaller so I invested lots of money in
[00:06:10] the little companies now I&#39;m not so sure
[00:06:13] and I&#39;m talking to the big companies and
[00:06:14] the big companies are telling me that
[00:06:15] they need 10 billion 20 billion 50
[00:06:18] billion 100 billion is 100 billion right
[00:06:21] they very very hard I talked Sam
[00:06:23] Stargate is Microsoft and open AI sort
[00:06:26] of co- project where they plan to invest
[00:06:28] a 100 billion into a Data Center and by
[00:06:31] the way that&#39;s not the only project
[00:06:33] where they&#39;re kind of working together
[00:06:34] the other one is the power plant the
[00:06:37] fusion power plant somewhere near
[00:06:39] Seattle Washington in that area that
[00:06:42] they hope could potentially provide a
[00:06:43] lot of you know maybe not unlimited
[00:06:45] energy but clean cheap inexpensive
[00:06:48] energy to power a lot of the stuff next
[00:06:50] he&#39;s talking about what he and Sam Alpin
[00:06:52] talked about Sam Alman is a close friend
[00:06:54] he believes it&#39;s going to take about 300
[00:06:56] billion maybe more I pointed out to him
[00:06:58] that I done the calculation on the
[00:06:59] amount of energy required and I and I
[00:07:02] then in the spirit of full disclosure
[00:07:03] went to the White House on Friday and
[00:07:04] told them that we need to become best
[00:07:06] friends with Canada because Canada has
[00:07:08] really nice people helped invent Ai and
[00:07:10] lots of hydrop power because we as a
[00:07:12] country do not have enough power to do
[00:07:13] this keep in mind too that there&#39;s a lot
[00:07:15] of sort of heat generated in these
[00:07:17] processes so the need to cool these
[00:07:20] buildings these infrastructures you know
[00:07:23] if you&#39;re running it somewhere where
[00:07:24] it&#39;s hot you also have to consider your
[00:07:26] AC Bill running it somewhere where it&#39;s
[00:07:28] naturally cold old could be very you
[00:07:31] know profitable you would greatly slash
[00:07:33] your costs because you don&#39;t have to
[00:07:34] worry about cooling or at least not as
[00:07:37] much the alternative is to have the
[00:07:39] Arabs fund it and I like the Arabs
[00:07:40] personally I spent lots of time there
[00:07:42] right but they&#39;re not going to adhere to
[00:07:43] our national security rules whereas
[00:07:44] Canada and the US are part of a trit
[00:07:46] where that we all so the1 billion $300
[00:07:48] billion data centers electricity starts
[00:07:49] becoming the scarce resource well but
[00:07:51] and by the way if you follow this line
[00:07:52] of reasoning why did I discuss Cuda and
[00:07:54] Nvidia if $300 billion is all going to
[00:07:56] go to Nvidia you know what to do in the
[00:07:57] stock market okay that&#39;s sounds like
[00:07:59] he&#39;s recommending people buy Nvidia not
[00:08:01] a stock recommendation I&#39;m not a
[00:08:03] licens well part of it so we&#39;re need a
[00:08:05] lot more chips but Intel is getting a
[00:08:07] lot of money from the US government
[00:08:08] AMD they&#39;re trying to build you know
[00:08:10] Fabs raise your hand if you have an
[00:08:12] Intel computer in your Intel chip in any
[00:08:14] of your Computing
[00:08:15] devices okay so much for the Monopoly
[00:08:19] well that that&#39;s that&#39;s the point though
[00:08:20] they once did have a monopoly absolutely
[00:08:21] and Nvidia has a monopoly now so are
[00:08:22] those barriers T like like Cuda is that
[00:08:24] is there something that other so I was
[00:08:26] talking to Percy Percy land the other
[00:08:27] day he&#39;s switching between tpus and
[00:08:29] Nvidia depending on what you can get
[00:08:30] access so for those who are not aware
[00:08:32] one big race that&#39;s happening right now
[00:08:34] is kind of the race to produce these
[00:08:37] chips that power AI growth and Nvidia
[00:08:40] has been kind of the I mean you can say
[00:08:41] the Undisputed leader in the field
[00:08:43] producing gpus graphical processing
[00:08:46] units and those have been very effective
[00:08:48] they kind of started with you know
[00:08:50] computer games acceleration because
[00:08:51] instead of running each process kind of
[00:08:53] independently finishing and running the
[00:08:55] next one which could create bottlenecks
[00:08:57] it runs them in parallel so for example
[00:08:59] if you&#39;re rendering and gain them on
[00:09:00] screen right you have some some crazy 3D
[00:09:03] game with solar rays and whatever that&#39;s
[00:09:05] running in you know 30 frames per second
[00:09:07] 60 frames per second you know what I
[00:09:08] mean you need to be able to Rend each
[00:09:10] pixel on the screen in real time you
[00:09:12] can&#39;t wait for it to get rendered you
[00:09:14] have to kind of render it all in
[00:09:16] parallel and gpus were really good at
[00:09:18] that that&#39;s part of the power of why
[00:09:20] Nvidia is so powerful as well as Cuda
[00:09:22] the programming language that they run
[00:09:24] on but we do have other alternatives for
[00:09:26] these AI chips the TPU the tensor
[00:09:29] processing unit is Google&#39;s creation
[00:09:31] recently we&#39;ve also seen Gro which is a
[00:09:34] something that they refer to as a
[00:09:35] language processing unit and lpu there&#39;s
[00:09:38] been some talk of neuromorphic chips
[00:09:41] which are more designed like the human
[00:09:42] brain they&#39;re not digital they&#39;re more
[00:09:44] analog but I don&#39;t know if any progress
[00:09:46] has been made in that field and it
[00:09:48] sounds like Sam Alman is cooking up a
[00:09:51] brand new chip that might eventually go
[00:09:53] on to compete with Nvidia that&#39;s still
[00:09:55] in the very early stages but that&#39;s the
[00:09:57] big question is NVIDIA continue to
[00:10:00] dominate or is somebody going to come
[00:10:01] out with something that&#39;s brand new and
[00:10:03] much much better for AI specifically cuz
[00:10:06] gpus aren&#39;t necessarily the best
[00:10:10] possible sort of architecture for AI
[00:10:14] they happen to be very good they happen
[00:10:15] to be the best thing we have right now
[00:10:17] but nothing&#39;s to say that some different
[00:10:19] architecture can&#39;t be a million times
[00:10:22] better just because it&#39;s built from
[00:10:23] scratch for AI inference and training
[00:10:26] absolutely and Nvidia has a monopoly now
[00:10:28] so are those barriers like like Cuda is
[00:10:30] that is there something that other so I
[00:10:32] was talking to Percy Percy the other day
[00:10:33] he&#39;s switching between tpus and Nvidia
[00:10:35] chips depending on what he can get
[00:10:36] access to because he doesn&#39;t have a
[00:10:38] choice if he had infinite money he would
[00:10:39] today he would pick the b200
[00:10:41] architecture out of Nvidia because it
[00:10:42] would be faster and I&#39;m not suggest I
[00:10:44] mean it&#39;s great to have competition i&#39;
[00:10:45] AMD and Lisa Su at create length they
[00:10:47] have built a a thing which will
[00:10:48] translate from um this Cuda architecture
[00:10:50] that you were describing to their own
[00:10:52] which is called rock it doesn&#39;t quite
[00:10:53] work yet they&#39;re working on it so Lisa
[00:10:55] Sue that&#39;s of AMD so one of the Nidia
[00:10:59] competitors AMD and Lisa Su great length
[00:11:01] they have built a a thing which will
[00:11:03] translate from um this Cuda architecture
[00:11:05] that you were describing to their own
[00:11:06] which is called roam it doesn&#39;t quite
[00:11:07] work yet that get transcribed as cud
[00:11:10] architecture but that&#39;s not what it is
[00:11:12] he&#39;s saying Cuda architecture cud da so
[00:11:14] the Nidia sort of architecture versus
[00:11:16] Rockham I&#39;m not familiar with that one I
[00:11:18] guess that&#39;s amd&#39;s version of Cuda U you
[00:11:21] were at Google for a long time and uh
[00:11:23] they invented the Transformer
[00:11:24] architecture it&#39;s all Peter&#39;s fault
[00:11:26] thanks to uh to brilliant people over
[00:11:27] there like Peter and Jeff and everyone
[00:11:29] um but now it doesn&#39;t seem like they&#39;re
[00:11:32] they kind of lost ini so I guess this is
[00:11:34] the part that caused all the hubub I&#39;m
[00:11:35] just skipping it I&#39;m not touching it
[00:11:37] it&#39;s not really related to AI
[00:11:39] necessarily unfortunately I think
[00:11:41] there&#39;s a lot of overlap with politics
[00:11:42] so I&#39;m just trying to avoid that but it
[00:11:44] seems like he&#39;s saying that it might be
[00:11:45] like a cultural issue but let&#39;s continue
[00:11:48] and see what else they&#39;ve talked about
[00:11:50] yes sir in terms of national security or
[00:11:52] interest have play a role or competition
[00:11:54] with China as well so I was the chairman
[00:11:56] of an AI commission that sort of looked
[00:11:57] at this very carefully and um you can
[00:11:59] read it it&#39;s about 752 pages and I&#39;ll
[00:12:01] just summarize it by saying we&#39;re ahead
[00:12:03] we need to stay ahead and we need lots
[00:12:04] of money to do so our customers were the
[00:12:05] senate in the house um and out of that
[00:12:08] came the chips act and a lot of other
[00:12:09] stuff like that um a rough scenario is
[00:12:12] that the chips act invested billions
[00:12:14] into building out the US infrastructure
[00:12:16] to develop AI chips and also I believe
[00:12:18] that&#39;s what limited a lot of the
[00:12:20] nvidia&#39;s export to China some of the
[00:12:23] best chips the most powerful chips it
[00:12:24] limited the exports to China how much
[00:12:27] they could ship and sell in China how it
[00:12:29] seems like that&#39;s creating a bit of a
[00:12:31] black market of people trying to import
[00:12:33] those into China through other means but
[00:12:36] if you assume the frontier models drive
[00:12:37] forward and a few of the open source
[00:12:39] models it&#39;s likely that a very small
[00:12:40] number of companies can play this game
[00:12:42] countries excuse me what are those
[00:12:43] countries or who are they countries with
[00:12:45] a lot of money and a lot of talent
[00:12:46] strong Educational Systems and a
[00:12:47] willingness to win the US is one of them
[00:12:49] China is another one how many others are
[00:12:51] there are there any
[00:12:52] others I don&#39;t know maybe but certainly
[00:12:55] the in your lifetimes the battle between
[00:12:57] the US and China for knowledge Supremacy
[00:12:59] is going to be the big fight right so
[00:13:01] the US government banned essentially the
[00:13:02] Invidia chips although they weren&#39;t
[00:13:03] allowed to say that was what they were
[00:13:04] doing but they actually did that into
[00:13:05] China um they have about a 10year chip
[00:13:08] advant we have a roughly 10e chip
[00:13:09] advantage in terms of subdv is sub five
[00:13:12] roughly 10 years wow um and so you&#39;re
[00:13:14] gonna have so an example would be today
[00:13:16] we&#39;re a couple of years ahead of China
[00:13:17] my guess is we&#39;ll get a few more years
[00:13:18] ahead of China and the Chinese are
[00:13:20] whopping mad about this it&#39;s like hugely
[00:13:21] upset about it so that&#39;s a big deal that
[00:13:23] was a decision made by the Trump
[00:13:24] Administration and furthered by the
[00:13:25] Biden Administration do you think that
[00:13:27] it&#39;s going to make that scale of
[00:13:28] investment I mean OB the chips act but
[00:13:29] beyond that build building a massive AI
[00:13:32] system so so as you know I I lead a an
[00:13:34] informal ad hoc non-legal group that&#39;s
[00:13:37] that&#39;s different from illegal exactly
[00:13:39] justar which includes all the usual
[00:13:41] which includes all The Usual Suspects
[00:13:43] yes and The Usual Suspects over the last
[00:13:44] year came up with basis of the reasoning
[00:13:46] that became the um uh uh the B
[00:13:49] administration&#39;s uh AI act which is the
[00:13:51] longest Presidential Directive in
[00:13:53] history you&#39;re talking the special
[00:13:53] competitive studies Pro no this is the
[00:13:55] actual the actual act from the executive
[00:13:58] office and there implementing the
[00:13:59] details so far they&#39;ve got it right and
[00:14:01] so for example one of the debates that
[00:14:02] we had for last year has been how do you
[00:14:05] detect danger in a system which has
[00:14:07] learned it but you don&#39;t know what to
[00:14:09] ask it okay so in other words it&#39;s a
[00:14:11] core it&#39;s a sort of a core problem it&#39;s
[00:14:12] learned something bad but it can&#39;t tell
[00:14:14] you what it learned and you don&#39;t know
[00:14:15] what to ask it and there&#39;s so many
[00:14:16] threats right like it learned how to mix
[00:14:18] chemistry in some new way but you don&#39;t
[00:14:19] know how to ask it and so people are
[00:14:21] working hard on that but we ultimately
[00:14:22] wrote in our memos to them that there
[00:14:24] was a threshold which we arbitrarily
[00:14:25] named as 10 to the 26 flops which
[00:14:27] technically is a measure of computation
[00:14:29] that that threshold you had to report to
[00:14:31] the government that you were doing this
[00:14:32] and that&#39;s part of the rule the EU to
[00:14:35] just make sure they were different did
[00:14:36] 10 to 25 yeah but it&#39;s all kind of close
[00:14:38] enough I think all of these distinctions
[00:14:39] go away because the technology will now
[00:14:41] the technical term is called Federated
[00:14:42] training where basically you can take
[00:14:43] pieces and Union them together so we may
[00:14:46] not be able to keep keep people safe
[00:14:48] from these new things well rumors are
[00:14:49] that that&#39;s how open ey has had to train
[00:14:50] partly because of the power uh
[00:14:51] consumption there&#39;s no one place where
[00:14:53] so this is interesting I haven&#39;t heard
[00:14:55] that specific terminology before so he&#39;s
[00:14:57] saying that you can kind of build
[00:14:58] different pie pieces of LMS or sort of
[00:15:00] AI systems you train those pieces
[00:15:02] separately and then you Union them
[00:15:05] together you glue them together we&#39;ve
[00:15:06] seen this with the recent paper
[00:15:08] published where you can take sort of the
[00:15:09] large smart model and a very like a
[00:15:11] cheaper faster model and have sort of
[00:15:14] another sort of gatekeeper another yet
[00:15:16] another a model that kind of chooses
[00:15:17] where it routes the questions to so
[00:15:20] certain questions need to be answered by
[00:15:21] the bigger model but there&#39;s a lot that
[00:15:23] can be answered just as effectively by
[00:15:26] the smaller model and so this model just
[00:15:27] routes them to the cheaper model when
[00:15:29] needed and the results have been
[00:15:31] astonishing because it&#39;s if I remember
[00:15:33] my numbers correctly it has shown in
[00:15:35] some cases to reduce the cost of running
[00:15:37] these things by 80% while maintaining
[00:15:40] something like 96% accuracy so for just
[00:15:43] and I don&#39;t recall those the exact
[00:15:45] numbers but it was some big big numbers
[00:15:46] like that so it&#39;s a tiny reduction in
[00:15:48] accuracy for a potentially massive
[00:15:51] reduction in cost so I&#39;m not sure if
[00:15:53] that&#39;s an example of specifically what
[00:15:55] he&#39;s talking about but this idea of
[00:15:56] Federated training sounds like it&#39;s
[00:15:58] training piece in individual sort of
[00:16:00] batches right and taking those pieces
[00:16:02] and then putting them together to create
[00:16:04] the final model next they&#39;re talking
[00:16:06] about war well let&#39;s talk to about a
[00:16:08] real war that&#39;s going on I know that uh
[00:16:10] something you&#39;ve been very involved in
[00:16:11] is uh the Ukraine war and in particular
[00:16:15] uh I know that uh something you&#39;ve been
[00:16:17] very involved in is uh the Ukraine war
[00:16:19] and in particular uh I how you talk
[00:16:21] about white stor and your your goal of
[00:16:23] having a 500,000 $500 drones destroy $5
[00:16:26] million tanks so Howes that changing
[00:16:28] Warfare I work for the Secretary of
[00:16:29] Defense for seven years and and tried to
[00:16:32] change the way we run our military I&#39;m
[00:16:34] I&#39;m not a particularly big fan of the
[00:16:35] military but it&#39;s very expensive and I
[00:16:36] wanted to see if I could be helpful and
[00:16:37] I think in my view I largely failed they
[00:16:38] gave me a medal so they must give medals
[00:16:41] to failure or you know whatever but my
[00:16:43] self-criticism was nothing has really
[00:16:44] changed and the system in America is not
[00:16:47] going to lead to real Innovation so
[00:16:49] watching the Russians use tanks to
[00:16:51] destroy apartment buildings with little
[00:16:52] old ladies and kids just drove me crazy
[00:16:54] so I decided to work on a company with
[00:16:55] your friend Sebastian thrun and as a
[00:16:57] former faculty member here and a bunch
[00:16:59] of Stanford people and the idea
[00:17:01] basically is to do two things use AI in
[00:17:03] complicated powerful ways for these
[00:17:04] essentially robotic War and the second
[00:17:06] one is to lower the cost of the robots
[00:17:07] now you sit there and you go why would a
[00:17:09] good liberal like me do that and the
[00:17:10] answer is that the whole theory of
[00:17:13] armies is tanks artilleries and Mort and
[00:17:15] we can eliminate all of them and we can
[00:17:17] make the penalty for invading a country
[00:17:18] at least by lamb essentially being
[00:17:20] impossible it should eliminate the kind
[00:17:22] of land battles well this this is Rel
[00:17:23] question is that does it give more of
[00:17:25] advantage to defense versus offense can
[00:17:26] you can you even make that distinction
[00:17:27] because I&#39;ve been doing this for the
[00:17:28] last year I&#39;ve learned a lot about war
[00:17:29] that I really did not want to know and
[00:17:31] one of the things to know about war is
[00:17:32] that the offense always has the
[00:17:33] advantage because you can always
[00:17:35] overwhelm the defensive systems and so
[00:17:37] you&#39;re better off as a strategy of
[00:17:38] National Defense to have a very strong
[00:17:40] offense that you can use if you need to
[00:17:42] and the systems that I and others are
[00:17:43] building will do that um because of the
[00:17:45] way the system works I now a licensed I
[00:17:47] think he might have misspoken there let
[00:17:48] me know in the comments if you think so
[00:17:50] too or I&#39;m missing something I think he
[00:17:52] meant to say that he will he and others
[00:17:54] like him will build incredible defensive
[00:17:57] systems to reduce the effectiveness of
[00:17:59] invading and using offensive systems
[00:18:01] that&#39;s how I&#39;m interpreting I think he
[00:18:03] kind of to me it sounds like he misspoke
[00:18:04] a little bit if if I understand
[00:18:05] correctly because of the way the system
[00:18:07] works I am now a licensed arms deer
[00:18:10] others are building we do that um
[00:18:11] because of the way the system works I am
[00:18:13] now a licensed arms dealer so computer
[00:18:15] scientist businessman arms dealer and
[00:18:19] I&#39;m sorry to agression I I don&#39;t know I
[00:18:21] do not recommend this in your Carew I
[00:18:22] stick with they are um and because of
[00:18:24] the way the laws work um we&#39;re doing
[00:18:25] this privately and then it&#39;s this is all
[00:18:27] legal with the support of the
[00:18:28] governments it goes straight into
[00:18:28] Ukraine and then they fight the war and
[00:18:30] and and without going into all the
[00:18:31] details things are pretty bad I think if
[00:18:33] in May or June if the Russians build up
[00:18:36] as they expecting to Ukraine will lose a
[00:18:38] whole chunk of its territory and will
[00:18:39] begin the process of losing the whole
[00:18:40] country so I believe this was recorded
[00:18:42] in August 2024 just a few days ago or at
[00:18:45] least that&#39;s when it was posted if you
[00:18:47] recall the news headlines about it all
[00:18:49] of them are from like a few hours ago so
[00:18:51] I think he&#39;s talking about 2025 I&#39;m
[00:18:54] assuming so he&#39;s talking about May or
[00:18:55] June of 2025 for most of History humans
[00:18:58] sort of had a mystical understanding of
[00:18:59] the universe and then there&#39;s the
[00:19:00] Scientific Revolution and the
[00:19:01] enlightenment um and in your article you
[00:19:03] argue that now these models are becoming
[00:19:05] so complicated and uh difficult to
[00:19:08] understand that we don&#39;t really know
[00:19:09] what&#39;s going on in them I&#39;ll take a
[00:19:11] quote from Richard fean he says what I
[00:19:12] cannot create I do not understand I saw
[00:19:13] this quote the other day but now people
[00:19:15] are creating things they do not that
[00:19:16] that they can create but they don&#39;t
[00:19:16] really understand what&#39;s inside of them
[00:19:17] is the nature of knowledge changing in a
[00:19:19] way are we gonna have to start just
[00:19:20] taking the word for these models without
[00:19:22] them able being able to explain it to us
[00:19:23] the analogy I would offer is to
[00:19:24] teenagers if you have a teenager you
[00:19:26] know that they&#39;re human but you can&#39;t
[00:19:27] quite figure out what they&#39;re thinking
[00:19:29] um but somehow we&#39;ve managed in society
[00:19:30] to adapt to the presence of teenagers
[00:19:32] right and they eventually grow out of
[00:19:33] that and this serious so it&#39;s probably
[00:19:35] the case we&#39;re going to have knowledge
[00:19:37] systems that we cannot fully
[00:19:38] characterize but we understand their
[00:19:40] boundaries right we understand the
[00:19:42] limits of what they can do and that&#39;s
[00:19:43] probably the best outcome we can get do
[00:19:44] you think we&#39;ll understand the limits we
[00:19:46] we&#39;ll get pretty good at it the
[00:19:47] consensus of my group that meets on
[00:19:49] every week is that eventually the way
[00:19:51] you&#39;ll do this it&#39;s called SOC called
[00:19:52] adversarial AI is that there will there
[00:19:54] will actually be companies that you will
[00:19:56] hire and pay money to to break your AI
[00:19:58] system so it&#39;ll be the r instead of
[00:19:59] human red teams which is what they do
[00:20:00] today you&#39;ll have whole companies and a
[00:20:02] whole industry of AI systems whose jobs
[00:20:04] are to break the existing AI systems and
[00:20:05] find their vulnerabilities especially
[00:20:07] the knowledge that they have that we
[00:20:08] can&#39;t figure out that makes sense to me
[00:20:09] it&#39;s also a great project for you here
[00:20:11] at Stanford because if you have a
[00:20:12] graduate student who has to figure out
[00:20:13] how to attack one of these large models
[00:20:15] and understand what it does that is a
[00:20:16] great skill to build the Next Generation
[00:20:18] so it makes sense to me that the two
[00:20:19] will travel together if that&#39;s something
[00:20:21] that interests you there&#39;s a Twitter SLX
[00:20:23] account Pini The prompter Who uh
[00:20:25] basically jailbreaks a lot of these
[00:20:27] models usually within a few days of
[00:20:28] their release so he&#39;s just of course one
[00:20:30] of uh many people that do sort of things
[00:20:33] like that he does it kind of simly for
[00:20:35] entertainment and for online media
[00:20:38] Clouts but if you think about it third
[00:20:40] party testing third party red teaming of
[00:20:43] AI models third party quality assurance
[00:20:45] right QA of these models as they roll
[00:20:48] out and have contact with consumers with
[00:20:50] businesses with organizations Etc as
[00:20:52] well as just with various infrastructure
[00:20:54] systems and factories automations Etc
[00:20:57] war of course that&#39;s going to be a Big
[00:20:58] Industry that doesn&#39;t really exist yet
[00:21:01] it it just is beginning to grow and yet
[00:21:04] that might be something interesting and
[00:21:06] profitable to get into if that&#39;s uh
[00:21:08] that&#39;s your cup of tea next he comments
[00:21:10] just a bit on adver serial AI you just
[00:21:13] mentioned adversarial I&#39;m wonder if
[00:21:15] elaborate on that more it seems to be
[00:21:16] besides obviously increase get more
[00:21:18] perform mod getting them to do what you
[00:21:20] want
[00:21:22] isue well you have to assume that the
[00:21:24] current hallucination problems become
[00:21:26] less right in as the technology gets
[00:21:28] better and so forth I&#39;m not suggesting
[00:21:29] it goes away and then you also have to
[00:21:31] assume that there are tests for efficacy
[00:21:33] so there has to be a way of knowing that
[00:21:34] the thing succeeded so in the example
[00:21:36] that I gave of the Tik Tok competitor
[00:21:37] and by the way I was not arguing that
[00:21:38] you should illegally steal everybody&#39;s
[00:21:39] music what you would do if you&#39;re a
[00:21:40] silicon value entrepreneur which
[00:21:41] hopefully all of you will be is if it
[00:21:43] took off then you&#39;d hire a whole bunch
[00:21:44] of lawyers to go clean the mess up right
[00:21:45] but if if nobody uses your product it
[00:21:47] doesn&#39;t matter that you stole all the
[00:21:48] content and do not quote me right right
[00:21:51] you&#39;re on camera that&#39;s right but you
[00:21:53] see my point in other words Silicon
[00:21:54] Valley will run these tests and clean up
[00:21:55] the mess and that&#39;s typically how those
[00:21:56] things are done so so my own View is
[00:21:58] that you&#39;ll see more and more um
[00:22:00] performative systems with even better
[00:22:02] test and eventually adversarial tests
[00:22:03] and that&#39;ll keep it within a box the
[00:22:05] technical term is called Chain of
[00:22:06] Thought reasoning and people believe
[00:22:07] that in the next few years you&#39;ll be
[00:22:09] able to generate a thousand steps of
[00:22:10] Chain of Thought reasoning right do this
[00:22:12] do this it&#39;s like building recipes right
[00:22:13] that the recipes you can run the recipe
[00:22:15] and you can actually test that It
[00:22:16] produced the correct outcome and that&#39;s
[00:22:17] how the system will work next they ask
[00:22:19] what&#39;s going to be driving AI progress
[00:22:20] is it more data more compute is it just
[00:22:23] like chips and Hardware the amounts of
[00:22:24] money being thrown around are
[00:22:26] mindboggling and um I&#39;ve chose I
[00:22:29] essentially invest in everything because
[00:22:30] I can&#39;t figure out who&#39;s going to win
[00:22:31] and the amounts of money that are
[00:22:33] following me are so large I think some
[00:22:35] of it is because the early money has
[00:22:36] been made and the big money people who
[00:22:37] don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing have to
[00:22:38] have an AI component and everything is
[00:22:40] now an AI investment so they can&#39;t tell
[00:22:41] the difference I Define ai as Learning
[00:22:43] Systems systems that actually learn so I
[00:22:44] think that&#39;s one of them the second is
[00:22:46] that there are very sophisticated new
[00:22:47] algorithms that are sort of post
[00:22:48] Transformers my friend my collaborator
[00:22:50] for a long time has invented a new non-
[00:22:51] Transformer architecture there&#39;s a group
[00:22:53] that I&#39;m funding in Paris that has
[00:22:54] claims to done the same thing so there&#39;s
[00:22:56] enormous invention there a lot of things
[00:22:57] at Stanford and the final thing is that
[00:22:59] there is a belief in the market that the
[00:23:01] invention of intelligence has infinite
[00:23:03] return so let&#39;s say you have you put $50
[00:23:05] billion of capital into a company you
[00:23:07] have to make an awful lot of money from
[00:23:08] intelligence to pay that back I mean
[00:23:10] when you phrase it like that it seems to
[00:23:11] make sense if you invent intelligence
[00:23:14] certainly that would have an infinite
[00:23:17] return so it&#39;s probably the case that
[00:23:18] we&#39;ll go through some huge investment
[00:23:20] bubble and then it&#39;ll sort itself out
[00:23:21] that&#39;s always been true in the past and
[00:23:23] it&#39;s likely to be true here and what you
[00:23:24] said earlier was you think that the
[00:23:26] leaders are pulling away from right now
[00:23:27] right now and and
[00:23:29] this is a really the question is roughly
[00:23:31] the following there&#39;s a company called
[00:23:32] mrr in France they done a really good
[00:23:34] job um and I&#39;m obviously an investor um
[00:23:36] they have produced their second version
[00:23:38] their third model is likely to be closed
[00:23:39] because it&#39;s so expensive they need
[00:23:41] revenue and they can&#39;t give their model
[00:23:42] away so this open source versus closed
[00:23:44] Source debate in our industry is huge
[00:23:46] and um my entire career was based on
[00:23:49] people being willing to share software
[00:23:50] in open source everything about me is
[00:23:52] open source much of Google&#39;s
[00:23:53] underpinnings were open source
[00:23:54] everything I&#39;ve done technically and yet
[00:23:56] it may be that the capital costs which
[00:23:57] are so immense fundamentally changes how
[00:23:59] software is built you and I were talking
[00:24:01] um my own view of software programmers
[00:24:03] is that software programmers
[00:24:04] productivity will at least double there
[00:24:05] are three or four software companies
[00:24:07] that are trying to do that I&#39;ve invested
[00:24:08] in all of them in and they&#39;re all trying
[00:24:10] to make software programmers more
[00:24:11] productive the most interesting one that
[00:24:12] I just met with is called augment and I
[00:24:14] always think of an individual programmer
[00:24:15] and they said that&#39;s not our Target our
[00:24:16] Target are these 100 person software
[00:24:17] programming teams on millions of lines
[00:24:19] of code where nobody knows what&#39;s going
[00:24:20] on that&#39;s a really good AI thing will
[00:24:22] they make money I hope so you mentioned
[00:24:24] that there&#39;s the combination of the
[00:24:25] context exension the agents and the text
[00:24:27] to action is going to unimaginable
[00:24:29] impacts first of all why is the
[00:24:31] combination important and second of all
[00:24:32] I know that you know you&#39;re not like a
[00:24:33] crystal ball and you can&#39;t necessarily
[00:24:35] tell the future but why do you think
[00:24:36] it&#39;s beyond anything that we could
[00:24:37] imagine I think largely because the
[00:24:38] context window allows you to solve the
[00:24:40] problem of recency the current models
[00:24:42] take a year to train roughly six six
[00:24:44] there 18 months six months of
[00:24:45] preparation six months of training six
[00:24:46] months of fine tuning so they&#39;re always
[00:24:47] out of date context window you can feed
[00:24:50] what happened like you can ask it
[00:24:51] questions about the uh the Hamas Israel
[00:24:53] war right in a context that&#39;s very
[00:24:55] powerful it becomes current like Google
[00:24:56] um in the case of Agents I&#39;ll give you
[00:24:58] an example I set up a foundation which
[00:24:59] is funding a nonprofit which starts
[00:25:01] there&#39;s a I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s
[00:25:02] Chemists in the room that I don&#39;t really
[00:25:03] understand chemistry there&#39;s a a tool
[00:25:05] called chro CW which was an LM based
[00:25:08] system that learned chemistry and what
[00:25:09] they do is they run it to generate
[00:25:10] chemistry hypotheses about proteins and
[00:25:12] they have a lab which runs the tests
[00:25:14] overnight and then it learns that&#39;s a
[00:25:16] huge acceleration accelerant in
[00:25:17] chemistry Material Science and so forth
[00:25:19] so that&#39;s that&#39;s an agent model and I
[00:25:21] think the text to action can be
[00:25:21] understood by just having a lot of sheet
[00:25:23] programmers right um and I don&#39;t think
[00:25:25] we understand what happens and this is
[00:25:26] again your area of expertise what happen
[00:25:28] happens when everyone has their own
[00:25:29] programmer I&#39;m not talking about turning
[00:25:30] on and off the lights you know I imagine
[00:25:32] another example um for some reason you
[00:25:34] don&#39;t like Google so you say build me a
[00:25:35] Google competitor yeah you personally
[00:25:37] you don&#39;t build me a Google competitor
[00:25:38] uh search the web build a UI make a good
[00:25:41] copy um add generative AI in an
[00:25:43] interesting way do it in 30 seconds and
[00:25:45] see if it works right so a lot of people
[00:25:49] believe that the incumbents including
[00:25:50] Google are vulnerable to this kind of an
[00:25:52] attack now we&#39;ll see there were a bunch
[00:25:53] of questions who were sent over by
[00:25:54] slider I want to give some of them
[00:25:55] upload so um here&#39;s one um we talked a
[00:25:57] little about this last year um how can
[00:25:58] we stop AI from influencing public
[00:25:59] opinion misinformation especially during
[00:26:00] the upcoming he&#39;s asked a bit about
[00:26:02] misinformation how can we prevent AI
[00:26:05] from causing misinformation he talks
[00:26:07] about how during his time working with
[00:26:08] YouTube that was a problem people would
[00:26:10] upload a video for profit for their own
[00:26:13] self-gain and as a result of
[00:26:15] misinformation he says well people could
[00:26:17] be hurt he even says people die so
[00:26:19] certainly that is a problem if you saw
[00:26:22] my yesterday&#39;s video about grock 2 and
[00:26:24] the images it generates they&#39;re very re
[00:26:26] looking and grock 2 does not seem to
[00:26:29] have any sort of safety rails in place
[00:26:31] it just generates whatever you ask for
[00:26:33] so heading into the selection certainly
[00:26:35] that could be an issue he talks a little
[00:26:37] bit about some sort of a digital
[00:26:38] authentication or a public key
[00:26:40] authentication basically if somebody
[00:26:42] like the president speaks there&#39;s some
[00:26:44] key that everybody else can verify
[00:26:46] saying okay this is him this is his
[00:26:48] original audio he mentions briefly that
[00:26:50] it&#39;s it seems like he&#39;s saying it&#39;s a
[00:26:51] shame that the American universities
[00:26:53] aren&#39;t getting as much resources for
[00:26:56] computes for Google cloud and other
[00:26:58] places like that and this explosion
[00:27:00] where all the big companies are
[00:27:01] basically gobbling up the available
[00:27:03] resources and so he&#39;s saying the right
[00:27:05] thing for us to do is to get them the
[00:27:07] resources they need to give the
[00:27:08] universities the compute the resources
[00:27:10] that they need to pursue research and
[00:27:12] development and all that stuff next they
[00:27:13] talk about automation who&#39;s getting
[00:27:15] replaced who&#39;s getting to be obsolete in
[00:27:18] the labor force so let&#39;s take a look at
[00:27:20] that really fast I&#39;ll defer to the real
[00:27:22] expert here uh as your amateur Economist
[00:27:24] taught by Eric um I I fundamentally
[00:27:27] believe that the the sort of college
[00:27:28] education High skills task will be fine
[00:27:30] because people will work with these
[00:27:31] systems I think the systems is no
[00:27:33] different from any other technology wave
[00:27:34] the dangerous jobs and the jobs which
[00:27:35] require very little human judgment will
[00:27:37] get replaced the next question is kind
[00:27:39] of like the global balance of AI power
[00:27:42] so the person asking the question
[00:27:43] specifically mentions us and China but
[00:27:46] as you see here Eric specifically
[00:27:48] focuses on India take a listen the most
[00:27:50] interesting country is India because the
[00:27:52] top AI people come from India to the us
[00:27:54] and we should let India keep some of its
[00:27:56] top talent not all of them but some of
[00:27:57] them um and they don&#39;t have the kind of
[00:27:58] training facilities and programs that we
[00:28:00] so richly have here to me India is the
[00:28:01] big swing state in that regard China&#39;s
[00:28:03] Lost it&#39;s not going to not going to come
[00:28:04] back they&#39;re not going to change the
[00:28:05] regime as much as people wish them to do
[00:28:07] Japan and Korea are clearly in our camp
[00:28:09] Taiwan is a fantastic country whose
[00:28:11] software is terrible so that&#39;s not gonna
[00:28:12] going to work um amazing hard and in the
[00:28:15] rest of the world there are not a lot of
[00:28:16] other good choices that are big German
[00:28:18] the Europe is screwed up because of
[00:28:19] Brussels it&#39;s not a new fact I spent 10
[00:28:20] years fighting them and I work really
[00:28:22] hard to get them to fix the the EU act
[00:28:24] and they still have all the restrictions
[00:28:26] that make it very difficult to do our
[00:28:27] kind of research in Europe my French
[00:28:28] friends have spent all their time
[00:28:29] battling Brussels and mcon who&#39;s a
[00:28:31] personal friend is fighting hard for
[00:28:33] this and so France I think has a chance
[00:28:34] I don&#39;t see I don&#39;t see Germany coming
[00:28:35] and the rest is not big
[00:28:36] enough yes ma&#39;am so I know you&#39;re an
[00:28:39] engineer by
[00:28:40] trainer um given the capabilities that
[00:28:43] you Enis these mod should we still spend
[00:28:44] Hing to yeah because because ultimately
[00:28:46] it&#39;s it&#39;s the old thing of why do you
[00:28:47] study English if you can speak English
[00:28:49] you get better at it right you really do
[00:28:50] need to understand how these systems
[00:28:51] work and I feel very strong yes sir yeah
[00:28:53] I&#39;m curious if you explore good answer
[00:28:55] distributed setting and I&#39;m asking
[00:28:56] because sure like making a large cluster
[00:28:58] but Ma are powerful there&#39;s a lot of
[00:28:59] small maches across the world so like
[00:29:01] you think like folding at home are a
[00:29:02] similar idea works for training yeah we
[00:29:04] look very hard this so the way the
[00:29:06] algorithms work is you have a very large
[00:29:07] Matrix and you have essentially a
[00:29:08] multiplication function so think of it
[00:29:10] as going back and forth and back and
[00:29:12] forth and these systems are completely
[00:29:13] limited by the speed of memory to CPU or
[00:29:15] GPU and in fact the next iteration of
[00:29:18] Nvidia chips has combined all those
[00:29:20] functions into one chip the chips are
[00:29:21] now so big that they glue them all
[00:29:22] together and in fact the package is so
[00:29:24] sensitive the package is put together in
[00:29:26] a clean room as well as the chip itself
[00:29:27] so the looks like supercomputers and
[00:29:29] speed of light especially memory
[00:29:31] interconnect really dominated so I think
[00:29:32] unlikely for a while is there a way to
[00:29:33] segment the element like so Jeff de last
[00:29:35] year when he spoke here talked about
[00:29:36] having these different parts of it you
[00:29:38] train separately and then kind of
[00:29:39] Federate them each you know in order to
[00:29:41] do that you&#39;d have to have 10 million
[00:29:42] such things and then you&#39;re the way you
[00:29:44] ask the questions would be too slow he&#39;s
[00:29:45] talking about eight or 10 12 not at Lev
[00:29:49] the back way back I know like after
[00:29:51] releas new yor time open using work for
[00:29:53] training do you think
[00:29:54] that&#39;s I used to do a lot of work on the
[00:29:56] music licensing stuff what I learned was
[00:29:58] that in the 60s there was a series of
[00:30:00] lawsuits that resulted in an agreement
[00:30:02] where you get a a stipulated royalty
[00:30:04] whenever your song is played even even
[00:30:06] they don&#39;t even know who you are so paid
[00:30:07] into a bank and my guess is it&#39;ll be the
[00:30:08] same thing there be lots of lawsuits and
[00:30:09] there&#39;ll be some kind of stipulated
[00:30:10] agreement which will just say you have
[00:30:12] to pay x per of whatever Revenue you
[00:30:14] have in order to use pass cap BMI cap
[00:30:16] BMI look them up it&#39;s long it will seem
[00:30:17] very old to you but I think that&#39;s how
[00:30:18] it will yes sir interesting like there&#39;s
[00:30:21] a few players that are dominating AI
[00:30:23] right they&#39;ll continue to dominate and
[00:30:24] they seem to overlap with the large
[00:30:25] companies that all the antitrust
[00:30:27] regulation is kind of focus on how do
[00:30:28] you see those two Trends kind of yeah
[00:30:30] like do you see Regulators breaking up
[00:30:31] these companies and how will that affect
[00:30:33] the yeah so in my career I helped
[00:30:36] Microsoft get broken up and it wasn&#39;t
[00:30:37] broken up and I fought fought for Google
[00:30:39] to not be broken up and it&#39;s not been
[00:30:40] broken up so it sure looks to me like
[00:30:41] the trend is not to be broken up um as
[00:30:43] long as the companies avoid being John D
[00:30:45] Rockefeller the senior and I studied
[00:30:46] this looked it up it&#39;s how antitrust law
[00:30:48] came I don&#39;t think the government is
[00:30:49] will act the re the reason you&#39;re seeing
[00:30:51] these large companies dominate is who
[00:30:52] has the capital to build these data
[00:30:54] centers right right so my friend Reed
[00:30:56] and my friend com
[00:30:58] two have we talked to you about the
[00:31:00] decision that they made to take
[00:31:01] inflection so I believe Mustafa he&#39;s
[00:31:02] talking about Mustafa siman who is the
[00:31:04] co-founder of Google Deep Mind friend
[00:31:06] Reed and my friend M coming next we two
[00:31:08] week have Reed talked to you about the
[00:31:10] decision that they made to take
[00:31:11] inflection and essentially PE part it
[00:31:12] into Microsoft basically they decided
[00:31:14] they couldn&#39;t raise the tens of billions
[00:31:15] of dollars is that number public that
[00:31:16] you mentioned earlier have
[00:31:18] have
[00:31:20] got we want
[00:31:24] this I was wondering where all this is
[00:31:26] going to leave countries where in b
[00:31:27] ipants in phun models and access to
[00:31:30] compu the rich get richer and the poor
[00:31:32] do the best they can um they&#39;ll have to
[00:31:34] the fact of the matter is this is a rich
[00:31:36] country&#39;s game right huge Capital lots
[00:31:38] of technically strong people strong
[00:31:39] government support right there are two
[00:31:41] examples there lots of other countries
[00:31:43] that have all sorts of problems they
[00:31:43] don&#39;t have those resources they&#39;ll have
[00:31:44] to find a partner they&#39;ll have to join
[00:31:46] with somebody else something like that I
[00:31:48] last we met you he&#39;s fairly blunt he&#39;s
[00:31:50] fairly straightforward he I think kind
[00:31:52] of calls it how he sees it and it really
[00:31:55] seems like he&#39;s not talking one side or
[00:31:56] the other he doesn&#39;t have he&#39;s not
[00:31:58] pumping his back so to speak so he&#39;s not
[00:32:00] saying the things that benefit his
[00:32:01] portfolio or whatever he&#39;s just like
[00:32:03] yeah this is how it&#39;s going to be this
[00:32:04] is how it works by default big companies
[00:32:06] are not going to broken up the rich get
[00:32:07] richer Etc and finally he&#39;s asked a
[00:32:10] little bit more about kind of the
[00:32:11] business and entrepreneur side of things
[00:32:13] if you&#39;re starting your own company you
[00:32:15] have a product idea what does that look
[00:32:16] like how do you develop it how do you
[00:32:18] create a lot of wealth with your own
[00:32:20] product here&#39;s his answer I want I think
[00:32:23] the last we met you you at hackathon at
[00:32:24] AGI house and I know you spent a lot of
[00:32:26] time helping like young people as they
[00:32:27] create a lot of wealth and you spoke
[00:32:28] very passionately about about wanting to
[00:32:30] to do that do you have any advice for
[00:32:31] folks here as they&#39;re building their
[00:32:32] they&#39;re writing their business PL for
[00:32:33] this class or policy proposals or
[00:32:34] research proposals um you know at this
[00:32:36] stage of the careers going forward well
[00:32:39] um I teach a class in the business
[00:32:40] school on this so you should come to my
[00:32:41] class um the I am struck by the speed
[00:32:44] which with which you can build
[00:32:46] demonstrations of new ideas so in that
[00:32:49] in one of the hack I did the winning
[00:32:51] team the command was fly the Drone
[00:32:53] between two towers and it was given a
[00:32:54] virtual drone space and it figured out
[00:32:56] how to fly the Drone what the word
[00:32:57] between them generated the code in
[00:32:58] Python and flew the Drone in the
[00:32:59] simulator through the tower I just it
[00:33:01] would have taken a week or two you know
[00:33:03] good professional programmers to do that
[00:33:05] um I&#39;m telling you that the ability to
[00:33:06] prototype quickly really you know part
[00:33:08] part of the problem being an
[00:33:09] entrepreneur is everything happens
[00:33:10] faster well now if you can&#39;t get your
[00:33:12] prototype built in a day using these
[00:33:14] various tools you need to think about
[00:33:16] that right because that&#39;s who your
[00:33:17] competitor is doing so I guess my
[00:33:18] biggest advice is when you start
[00:33:19] thinking about a company is find the
[00:33:20] right a business CL plan in fact you
[00:33:22] should ask the computer to write your
[00:33:23] business plan for you
[00:33:25] um talk about that after leave it and
[00:33:28] and but I think it&#39;s very important to
[00:33:30] prototype your idea using these tools as
[00:33:32] quickly as you can because you can be
[00:33:33] sure there&#39;s another person doing
[00:33:34] exactly that same thing in another
[00:33:36] company in another University in a place
[00:33:38] that You&#39; all right
[00:33:40] thank very cool so this piece was uh
[00:33:43] taken down so apparently it&#39;s not even
[00:33:44] online right now but hopefully those few
[00:33:47] little Clips give you glips about what
[00:33:49] he thinks of AI you know I&#39;ve kind of
[00:33:51] cut out all the pieces that I think
[00:33:53] caused the controversy or whatever that
[00:33:55] situation was I don&#39;t think it really
[00:33:56] had anything to do with AI or anything
[00:33:58] of of substance I mean maybe touched on
[00:34:01] some political issues but whatever this
[00:34:03] is a person with a lot of really
[00:34:05] technical background and even though
[00:34:07] he&#39;s more of like a business guy he is
[00:34:10] spoken of with a lot of respect by all
[00:34:12] the engineers and all the very highly
[00:34:14] technical people in the Bay Area in the
[00:34:16] Silicon Valley he&#39;s somebody that really
[00:34:17] understands the tech space looks like
[00:34:19] Forbes has him listed as having a netw
[00:34:21] worth of almost $24 billion he&#39;s good
[00:34:25] friends he said with Sam Alman president
[00:34:27] of France France sounds like he knows
[00:34:29] all the co-founders of various AI
[00:34:31] companies big and small I mean this is
[00:34:33] somebody that&#39;s very very on the inside
[00:34:35] this is somebody that knows where things
[00:34:37] are going so certainly when he says
[00:34:39] something I tend to listen I put a great
[00:34:41] deal of weight into what he&#39;s saying and
[00:34:43] what he&#39;s saying is this AI wave is just
[00:34:47] starting we have two massive countries
[00:34:49] two big countries with the capital and
[00:34:50] the talent and everything else that&#39;s
[00:34:52] needed that are vying for AI Supremacy
[00:34:54] the issues with the chips and the power
[00:34:56] and the data while those are bottlenecks
[00:34:59] it seems like they will slowly be
[00:35:01] perhaps even maybe not that slowly
[00:35:03] slowly but but be improved you mentioned
[00:35:05] building data centers and various other
[00:35:07] AI infrastructure in Canada potentially
[00:35:10] which makes a lot of sense if you think
[00:35:12] about it lots of open land tends to be
[00:35:14] colder which again you know Heating and
[00:35:17] the generation of heat and having to
[00:35:19] cool these facilities is a concern tons
[00:35:22] land very friendly government to the US
[00:35:24] you know in factorio how do you just
[00:35:26] like find a big chunk of the map where
[00:35:28] there&#39;s a lot of open land and you&#39;d
[00:35:30] build all your nuclear power plants
[00:35:32] you&#39;d build out your entire like
[00:35:34] electricity infrastructure there just
[00:35:36] have a cable going back to where you
[00:35:38] need electricity to be it begs the
[00:35:40] question is this the future of Canada
[00:35:42] I&#39;m only kidding of course folks but the
[00:35:45] more and more I think about it there is
[00:35:46] a lot of land it&#39;s close by and it&#39;s
[00:35:49] cold and certainly that would be
[00:35:51] phenomenal for the revenue of Canada to
[00:35:53] generate some sort of tax some sort of
[00:35:55] Revenue based on right one of the kind
[00:35:57] of superpowers building out the
[00:35:59] infrastructure it needs to stay dominant
[00:36:01] in the AI race right I mean they&#39;re
[00:36:03] talking about creating 100 billion doll
[00:36:06] data centers potentially even the
[00:36:08] estimates a size 300 billion so that&#39;s
[00:36:10] that&#39;s one company that&#39;s not even the
[00:36:12] US government supported projects that&#39;s
[00:36:15] just a publicly traded company doing
[00:36:17] that sounds like he&#39;s really believing
[00:36:19] in Nvidia and the power of Nvidia and
[00:36:21] it&#39;s Cuda sort of software that the
[00:36:24] chips run on and if I&#39;m understanding
[00:36:26] him correctly he&#39;s not really seeing any
[00:36:28] competition to that I mean there&#39;s some
[00:36:30] things in the Horizon maybe possibly but
[00:36:32] nothing yet so it sounds like a lot of
[00:36:35] this money like a lot of it will be
[00:36:36] flowing into Nvidia and of course this
[00:36:39] idea that as the context window expands
[00:36:41] it&#39;ll become more and more sort of
[00:36:44] similar to training in a sense that
[00:36:46] right if it takes a while to train up a
[00:36:47] model but it can do in context learning
[00:36:50] meaning that you&#39;re able to just upload
[00:36:51] books and stuff to the finished model
[00:36:53] it&#39;s able to learn from them which we&#39;ve
[00:36:54] seen that with Gemini they found a
[00:36:56] language that doesn&#39;t have an a lot of
[00:36:57] online presence only something like 24
[00:37:00] people in the world speak it but they
[00:37:01] have some notebooks and manuscripts and
[00:37:03] stuff like that they uploaded to gini
[00:37:05] the actual finished trained Gemini and
[00:37:08] that model was able to learn how to
[00:37:11] speak it how to create sentences in it
[00:37:13] it wasn&#39;t trained on it it would learned
[00:37:15] in context right so as the context
[00:37:18] window ramps up to 10 million tokens
[00:37:21] that certainly seems like it would
[00:37:22] change how we think about pre- and
[00:37:25] posttraining or in other words once the
[00:37:27] model is trained it doesn&#39;t stop
[00:37:29] learning if you wanted to learn about a
[00:37:31] specific thing that you wanted to learn
[00:37:33] about maybe it&#39;s you know you have a
[00:37:34] company or that that have millions of
[00:37:37] documents and procedures and stuff like
[00:37:39] that just kind of like everywhere but no
[00:37:41] one person understands all of it well in
[00:37:43] the past that was kind of useless it
[00:37:45] doesn&#39;t really help you but if you can
[00:37:47] upload it to a model like that all of a
[00:37:49] sudden it knows all those things about
[00:37:51] your company it can train people on it
[00:37:54] it can answer your questions it can kind
[00:37:55] of manage it update see if there&#39;s any
[00:37:58] conflicts anywhere in it so instead of
[00:38:00] training a brand new model on that you
[00:38:02] just use an existing model and upload
[00:38:04] that stuff into the 10 million token
[00:38:07] context window combine that with text to
[00:38:09] action which is another word I&#39;ve heard
[00:38:11] it before this phrase but it&#39;s not that
[00:38:14] often used I feel like but yeah I mean
[00:38:16] that&#39;s what agents are basically right
[00:38:18] it&#39;s text to action you type in impr
[00:38:21] prompt and it goes and does that action
[00:38:23] it does the thing you&#39;re asking it to do
[00:38:25] as they get better at long-term plan
[00:38:27] long-term reasoning and actually Deep
[00:38:29] Mind CEO de saabi is also just had an
[00:38:32] interview talking about something very
[00:38:34] very similar he&#39;s talking about this
[00:38:36] idea that as agents become better
[00:38:38] long-term reasoners and planners they
[00:38:40] will become better and better at
[00:38:42] carrying out those long Horizon tasks
[00:38:44] and he&#39;s saying we&#39;re not ready for it
[00:38:46] when everybody can have these qualified
[00:38:49] capable agents right he&#39;s saying it&#39;s
[00:38:51] going to have an impact on the world at
[00:38:53] a scale no one understands yet and that
[00:38:56] certainly I think is true that&#39;s
[00:38:58] certainly something that I fully agree
[00:39:00] with a lot of our social structures and
[00:39:03] stuff we&#39;re kind of used to will have to
[00:39:05] change and of course he&#39;s saying if
[00:39:06] you&#39;re worried about losing your job
[00:39:08] having a degree that&#39;s going to become
[00:39:09] worthless you know should you still
[00:39:11] learn to code he&#39;s saying business as
[00:39:13] usual there yes some easy simple jobs or
[00:39:16] maybe very dangerous jobs jobs where
[00:39:18] there&#39;s not a lot of hard decisions to
[00:39:20] be made yes those might go away and yes
[00:39:23] these AIS might be pretty good at coding
[00:39:25] creating projects but learning all those
[00:39:27] skills getting better at those skills
[00:39:28] learning how everything works that&#39;s
[00:39:30] that&#39;s not going out of fashion that&#39;s
[00:39:32] never going to just disappear his
[00:39:34] example was you know if you can speak
[00:39:36] English why would you learn English
[00:39:38] right why would you study English well
[00:39:40] it&#39;s to get better at it to improve your
[00:39:42] abilities with it so I hope you enjoyed
[00:39:44] that make sure you subscribed please
[00:39:46] give me a thumbs up if you enjoyed it my
[00:39:48] name is Wes rth and I&#39;ll see you next
[00:39:49] time thank you for watching
[00:00:00] Eric Schmidt gave a facety talk at
[00:00:02] Stanford just a few days ago about AI he
[00:00:05] was of course the former Google CEO and
[00:00:08] perceived by people as a bit of a
[00:00:10] futurist he&#39;s able to kind of often very
[00:00:12] accurately predict where technology is
[00:00:14] going the interview was over an hour
[00:00:16] long and it was fascinating covering
[00:00:18] topics like ai ai agents where this
[00:00:20] whole thing is going Etc and had a lot
[00:00:22] of pretty brilliant insights by Eric
[00:00:25] into where he believes this is going but
[00:00:28] unfortunately at our plus long interview
[00:00:30] there was just one comment that people
[00:00:32] didn&#39;t like the media machine went into
[00:00:35] overdrive mode and the video has been
[00:00:38] basically taken down it&#39;s no longer
[00:00:40] available to see it was deemed too hot
[00:00:43] for the internet and no longer available
[00:00:45] but just between you and me and keep
[00:00:48] this on the DL please I might have a
[00:00:51] copy of it maybe allegedly I feel like I
[00:00:54] need to say something here that reduces
[00:00:55] my liability some sort of a legal
[00:00:58] statement like I take no resp
[00:00:59] responsibility for my actions yeah that
[00:01:01] should do subscribe for more sweet AI
[00:01:03] content let&#39;s take a look at a few clips
[00:01:05] from this Stanford lecture by Eric
[00:01:08] Schmidt about AI I think you will like
[00:01:10] it if you do hit that thumbs up please
[00:01:13] because this is somebody that has a bit
[00:01:14] of a Clairvoyance about the future of
[00:01:16] tech he tends to see how things will
[00:01:18] unfold with startling accuracy so before
[00:01:21] he starts talking he asks the class to
[00:01:23] basically Define what a context window
[00:01:25] is and what AI agents are context
[00:01:28] Windows of course you can think of it as
[00:01:29] sort of a short-term memory it&#39;s
[00:01:31] basically the amount of words that a
[00:01:33] large language model can read and also
[00:01:36] write and output and kind of interact
[00:01:38] with right so if it has a large context
[00:01:40] window you can give it a whole book and
[00:01:42] then ask it questions about the book if
[00:01:44] it has a very short context window we
[00:01:46] might start answering a question and
[00:01:47] then halfway through forget what I was
[00:01:49] talking about it would be kind of a
[00:01:50] whoops I run out of memory type of thing
[00:01:52] and AI agents are things they can sort
[00:01:55] of complete tasks on your behalf you can
[00:01:56] tell them to go order something off of
[00:01:58] Amazon they&#39;ll go they&#39;ll search they&#39;ll
[00:02:00] do reviews they&#39;ll check the sizes the
[00:02:02] colors whatever and then order it and
[00:02:04] then report that they&#39;ve done it back to
[00:02:05] you so you can think of it as kind of a
[00:02:07] smart intern that&#39;s online that&#39;s Ai and
[00:02:10] Eric is talking about potentially a
[00:02:11] seeing a 10 million token context window
[00:02:15] sometime soon potentially in next two
[00:02:17] years or so he doesn&#39;t specify a
[00:02:19] timeline but soon so the first thing he
[00:02:21] talks about is what are we going to
[00:02:23] expect to happen in the next 2 to 5
[00:02:26] years so in the short term specifically
[00:02:29] at the intersection of something like a
[00:02:31] 10 million token context window and
[00:02:33] improving autonomous AI agents take a
[00:02:35] listen so an agent is something that
[00:02:37] does that does some kind of a task
[00:02:39] another definition would be that it&#39;s an
[00:02:40] LM State and memory okay can anybody
[00:02:44] again scientist can can any of you
[00:02:45] define text action taking text and
[00:02:47] turning into an action right here go
[00:02:48] ahead yes instead of taking text and
[00:02:50] turning it into more text more text
[00:02:52] taking text and have the AI trigger
[00:02:54] actions based so another definition
[00:02:56] would be language to python a pro
[00:02:59] programming language I never wanted to
[00:03:00] see survive and and everything in AI is
[00:03:02] being done in Python there&#39;s a new
[00:03:03] language called Mojo that has just come
[00:03:05] out which looks like they finally have
[00:03:06] addressed AI programming but we&#39;ll see
[00:03:07] if that actually survives over the
[00:03:08] dominance of python um one more
[00:03:10] technical question why is NVIDIA worth2
[00:03:12] trillion doll and the other companies
[00:03:14] are struggling technical answer I mean I
[00:03:16] think it just boils down to like most of
[00:03:17] code needs to run with C optimizations
[00:03:19] that currently only support so other
[00:03:21] companies can make whatever they want to
[00:03:22] but unless they have the 10 years of
[00:03:24] software there you don&#39;t have the
[00:03:25] machine learning optimization I like to
[00:03:27] think of Cuda as the C programming
[00:03:29] language for
[00:03:30] yeah right that&#39;s the way I like to
[00:03:31] think of it was founded in 2008 I always
[00:03:32] thought it was a terrible language and
[00:03:34] yet it&#39;s become dominant there&#39;s another
[00:03:35] Insight there&#39;s a set of Open Source
[00:03:36] libraries which are highly optimized to
[00:03:38] Cuda and not anything else and everybody
[00:03:39] who builds all these Stacks right this
[00:03:41] is completely missed in any of the
[00:03:42] discussions right the com it&#39;s
[00:03:44] technically called VM and a whole bunch
[00:03:45] of libraries like that highly optimized
[00:03:47] Cuda very hard to replicate that if
[00:03:48] you&#39;re a competitor so what does all
[00:03:50] this mean in the next year you&#39;re going
[00:03:52] to see very large context Windows agents
[00:03:56] and text action when they are delivered
[00:03:58] at scale it&#39;s going to have an impact on
[00:03:59] world at a scale that no one understands
[00:04:01] yet much bigger than the horrific impact
[00:04:03] we&#39;ve had on by social media right in my
[00:04:05] view so here&#39;s why in a context window
[00:04:07] you can basically use that as short-term
[00:04:08] memory and I was shocked that context
[00:04:11] Windows get this long the technical
[00:04:12] reasons have to do with the fact that
[00:04:13] it&#39;s hard to serve hard to calculate and
[00:04:14] so forth the interesting thing about
[00:04:15] short-term memory when you feed the you
[00:04:18] ask a question read 20 books you give it
[00:04:20] the text of the books is the query and
[00:04:22] you say tell me what they say it forgets
[00:04:23] the middle which is exactly how human
[00:04:25] brains work too right that&#39;s where we
[00:04:26] are with respect to agents there are
[00:04:28] people who are now building essentially
[00:04:30] llm agents and the way they do it is
[00:04:31] they read something like chemistry they
[00:04:33] discover the principles of chemistry and
[00:04:34] then they test it and then they add that
[00:04:36] back into their understanding right
[00:04:38] that&#39;s extremely powerful and then the
[00:04:40] third thing as I mentioned is text
[00:04:41] action so I&#39;ll give you an example the
[00:04:43] government is in the process of trying
[00:04:45] to ban Tik to we&#39;ll see if that actually
[00:04:46] happens if Tik Tok is banned here&#39;s what
[00:04:48] I propose each and every one of you do
[00:04:49] say to your L the foll make me a copy of
[00:04:53] Tik Tok steal all the users steal all
[00:04:55] the music put my preferences in it
[00:04:57] produce this program in the next 30
[00:04:59] seconds release it and in one hour if
[00:05:01] it&#39;s not viral do something different
[00:05:03] along the same lines that&#39;s the command
[00:05:05] boom boom boom boom right you understand
[00:05:08] how powerful that is if you could go
[00:05:09] from arbitrary language to arbitrary
[00:05:11] digital command which is essentially
[00:05:12] what python in this scenario is imagine
[00:05:14] that each and every human on the planet
[00:05:16] has their own programmer that actually
[00:05:18] does what they want as opposed to the
[00:05:18] programmers that work for me who don&#39;t
[00:05:20] do what I ask or potentially a whole
[00:05:22] Army of AI influencers each with its own
[00:05:25] little tweak that are completely managed
[00:05:28] by these AI agents trying to fill a
[00:05:30] certain Niche a certain Gap a certain
[00:05:32] personality type you can have an
[00:05:34] infinite amount of them boasting 24
[00:05:36] hours a day the programmers here know
[00:05:38] what I&#39;m talking about so imagine a non-
[00:05:39] arrogant programmer that actually does
[00:05:41] what you want and you don&#39;t have to pay
[00:05:42] all that money to and there&#39;s infinite
[00:05:44] supply of these program this is all
[00:05:45] within the next year or two very soon
[00:05:47] those three things and I&#39;m quite
[00:05:49] convinced it&#39;s the union of those three
[00:05:50] things that will happen in the next wave
[00:05:53] so you asked about what else is going to
[00:05:54] happen um every six months I oscillate
[00:05:57] so we&#39;re on a it&#39;s an even odd
[00:05:58] oscillation the moment the gap between
[00:06:01] the frontier models which they&#39;re now
[00:06:02] only three I&#39;ll ref few who they are and
[00:06:05] everybody else appears to me to be
[00:06:06] getting larger six months ago I was
[00:06:08] convinced that the Gap was getting
[00:06:09] smaller so I invested lots of money in
[00:06:10] the little companies now I&#39;m not so sure
[00:06:13] and I&#39;m talking to the big companies and
[00:06:14] the big companies are telling me that
[00:06:15] they need 10 billion 20 billion 50
[00:06:18] billion 100 billion is 100 billion right
[00:06:21] they very very hard I talked Sam
[00:06:23] Stargate is Microsoft and open AI sort
[00:06:26] of co- project where they plan to invest
[00:06:28] a 100 billion into a Data Center and by
[00:06:31] the way that&#39;s not the only project
[00:06:33] where they&#39;re kind of working together
[00:06:34] the other one is the power plant the
[00:06:37] fusion power plant somewhere near
[00:06:39] Seattle Washington in that area that
[00:06:42] they hope could potentially provide a
[00:06:43] lot of you know maybe not unlimited
[00:06:45] energy but clean cheap inexpensive
[00:06:48] energy to power a lot of the stuff next
[00:06:50] he&#39;s talking about what he and Sam Alpin
[00:06:52] talked about Sam Alman is a close friend
[00:06:54] he believes it&#39;s going to take about 300
[00:06:56] billion maybe more I pointed out to him
[00:06:58] that I done the calculation on the
[00:06:59] amount of energy required and I and I
[00:07:02] then in the spirit of full disclosure
[00:07:03] went to the White House on Friday and
[00:07:04] told them that we need to become best
[00:07:06] friends with Canada because Canada has
[00:07:08] really nice people helped invent Ai and
[00:07:10] lots of hydrop power because we as a
[00:07:12] country do not have enough power to do
[00:07:13] this keep in mind too that there&#39;s a lot
[00:07:15] of sort of heat generated in these
[00:07:17] processes so the need to cool these
[00:07:20] buildings these infrastructures you know
[00:07:23] if you&#39;re running it somewhere where
[00:07:24] it&#39;s hot you also have to consider your
[00:07:26] AC Bill running it somewhere where it&#39;s
[00:07:28] naturally cold old could be very you
[00:07:31] know profitable you would greatly slash
[00:07:33] your costs because you don&#39;t have to
[00:07:34] worry about cooling or at least not as
[00:07:37] much the alternative is to have the
[00:07:39] Arabs fund it and I like the Arabs
[00:07:40] personally I spent lots of time there
[00:07:42] right but they&#39;re not going to adhere to
[00:07:43] our national security rules whereas
[00:07:44] Canada and the US are part of a trit
[00:07:46] where that we all so the1 billion $300
[00:07:48] billion data centers electricity starts
[00:07:49] becoming the scarce resource well but
[00:07:51] and by the way if you follow this line
[00:07:52] of reasoning why did I discuss Cuda and
[00:07:54] Nvidia if $300 billion is all going to
[00:07:56] go to Nvidia you know what to do in the
[00:07:57] stock market okay that&#39;s sounds like
[00:07:59] he&#39;s recommending people buy Nvidia not
[00:08:01] a stock recommendation I&#39;m not a
[00:08:03] licens well part of it so we&#39;re need a
[00:08:05] lot more chips but Intel is getting a
[00:08:07] lot of money from the US government
[00:08:08] AMD they&#39;re trying to build you know
[00:08:10] Fabs raise your hand if you have an
[00:08:12] Intel computer in your Intel chip in any
[00:08:14] of your Computing
[00:08:15] devices okay so much for the Monopoly
[00:08:19] well that that&#39;s that&#39;s the point though
[00:08:20] they once did have a monopoly absolutely
[00:08:21] and Nvidia has a monopoly now so are
[00:08:22] those barriers T like like Cuda is that
[00:08:24] is there something that other so I was
[00:08:26] talking to Percy Percy land the other
[00:08:27] day he&#39;s switching between tpus and
[00:08:29] Nvidia depending on what you can get
[00:08:30] access so for those who are not aware
[00:08:32] one big race that&#39;s happening right now
[00:08:34] is kind of the race to produce these
[00:08:37] chips that power AI growth and Nvidia
[00:08:40] has been kind of the I mean you can say
[00:08:41] the Undisputed leader in the field
[00:08:43] producing gpus graphical processing
[00:08:46] units and those have been very effective
[00:08:48] they kind of started with you know
[00:08:50] computer games acceleration because
[00:08:51] instead of running each process kind of
[00:08:53] independently finishing and running the
[00:08:55] next one which could create bottlenecks
[00:08:57] it runs them in parallel so for example
[00:08:59] if you&#39;re rendering and gain them on
[00:09:00] screen right you have some some crazy 3D
[00:09:03] game with solar rays and whatever that&#39;s
[00:09:05] running in you know 30 frames per second
[00:09:07] 60 frames per second you know what I
[00:09:08] mean you need to be able to Rend each
[00:09:10] pixel on the screen in real time you
[00:09:12] can&#39;t wait for it to get rendered you
[00:09:14] have to kind of render it all in
[00:09:16] parallel and gpus were really good at
[00:09:18] that that&#39;s part of the power of why
[00:09:20] Nvidia is so powerful as well as Cuda
[00:09:22] the programming language that they run
[00:09:24] on but we do have other alternatives for
[00:09:26] these AI chips the TPU the tensor
[00:09:29] processing unit is Google&#39;s creation
[00:09:31] recently we&#39;ve also seen Gro which is a
[00:09:34] something that they refer to as a
[00:09:35] language processing unit and lpu there&#39;s
[00:09:38] been some talk of neuromorphic chips
[00:09:41] which are more designed like the human
[00:09:42] brain they&#39;re not digital they&#39;re more
[00:09:44] analog but I don&#39;t know if any progress
[00:09:46] has been made in that field and it
[00:09:48] sounds like Sam Alman is cooking up a
[00:09:51] brand new chip that might eventually go
[00:09:53] on to compete with Nvidia that&#39;s still
[00:09:55] in the very early stages but that&#39;s the
[00:09:57] big question is NVIDIA continue to
[00:10:00] dominate or is somebody going to come
[00:10:01] out with something that&#39;s brand new and
[00:10:03] much much better for AI specifically cuz
[00:10:06] gpus aren&#39;t necessarily the best
[00:10:10] possible sort of architecture for AI
[00:10:14] they happen to be very good they happen
[00:10:15] to be the best thing we have right now
[00:10:17] but nothing&#39;s to say that some different
[00:10:19] architecture can&#39;t be a million times
[00:10:22] better just because it&#39;s built from
[00:10:23] scratch for AI inference and training
[00:10:26] absolutely and Nvidia has a monopoly now
[00:10:28] so are those barriers like like Cuda is
[00:10:30] that is there something that other so I
[00:10:32] was talking to Percy Percy the other day
[00:10:33] he&#39;s switching between tpus and Nvidia
[00:10:35] chips depending on what he can get
[00:10:36] access to because he doesn&#39;t have a
[00:10:38] choice if he had infinite money he would
[00:10:39] today he would pick the b200
[00:10:41] architecture out of Nvidia because it
[00:10:42] would be faster and I&#39;m not suggest I
[00:10:44] mean it&#39;s great to have competition i&#39;
[00:10:45] AMD and Lisa Su at create length they
[00:10:47] have built a a thing which will
[00:10:48] translate from um this Cuda architecture
[00:10:50] that you were describing to their own
[00:10:52] which is called rock it doesn&#39;t quite
[00:10:53] work yet they&#39;re working on it so Lisa
[00:10:55] Sue that&#39;s of AMD so one of the Nidia
[00:10:59] competitors AMD and Lisa Su great length
[00:11:01] they have built a a thing which will
[00:11:03] translate from um this Cuda architecture
[00:11:05] that you were describing to their own
[00:11:06] which is called roam it doesn&#39;t quite
[00:11:07] work yet that get transcribed as cud
[00:11:10] architecture but that&#39;s not what it is
[00:11:12] he&#39;s saying Cuda architecture cud da so
[00:11:14] the Nidia sort of architecture versus
[00:11:16] Rockham I&#39;m not familiar with that one I
[00:11:18] guess that&#39;s amd&#39;s version of Cuda U you
[00:11:21] were at Google for a long time and uh
[00:11:23] they invented the Transformer
[00:11:24] architecture it&#39;s all Peter&#39;s fault
[00:11:26] thanks to uh to brilliant people over
[00:11:27] there like Peter and Jeff and everyone
[00:11:29] um but now it doesn&#39;t seem like they&#39;re
[00:11:32] they kind of lost ini so I guess this is
[00:11:34] the part that caused all the hubub I&#39;m
[00:11:35] just skipping it I&#39;m not touching it
[00:11:37] it&#39;s not really related to AI
[00:11:39] necessarily unfortunately I think
[00:11:41] there&#39;s a lot of overlap with politics
[00:11:42] so I&#39;m just trying to avoid that but it
[00:11:44] seems like he&#39;s saying that it might be
[00:11:45] like a cultural issue but let&#39;s continue
[00:11:48] and see what else they&#39;ve talked about
[00:11:50] yes sir in terms of national security or
[00:11:52] interest have play a role or competition
[00:11:54] with China as well so I was the chairman
[00:11:56] of an AI commission that sort of looked
[00:11:57] at this very carefully and um you can
[00:11:59] read it it&#39;s about 752 pages and I&#39;ll
[00:12:01] just summarize it by saying we&#39;re ahead
[00:12:03] we need to stay ahead and we need lots
[00:12:04] of money to do so our customers were the
[00:12:05] senate in the house um and out of that
[00:12:08] came the chips act and a lot of other
[00:12:09] stuff like that um a rough scenario is
[00:12:12] that the chips act invested billions
[00:12:14] into building out the US infrastructure
[00:12:16] to develop AI chips and also I believe
[00:12:18] that&#39;s what limited a lot of the
[00:12:20] nvidia&#39;s export to China some of the
[00:12:23] best chips the most powerful chips it
[00:12:24] limited the exports to China how much
[00:12:27] they could ship and sell in China how it
[00:12:29] seems like that&#39;s creating a bit of a
[00:12:31] black market of people trying to import
[00:12:33] those into China through other means but
[00:12:36] if you assume the frontier models drive
[00:12:37] forward and a few of the open source
[00:12:39] models it&#39;s likely that a very small
[00:12:40] number of companies can play this game
[00:12:42] countries excuse me what are those
[00:12:43] countries or who are they countries with
[00:12:45] a lot of money and a lot of talent
[00:12:46] strong Educational Systems and a
[00:12:47] willingness to win the US is one of them
[00:12:49] China is another one how many others are
[00:12:51] there are there any
[00:12:52] others I don&#39;t know maybe but certainly
[00:12:55] the in your lifetimes the battle between
[00:12:57] the US and China for knowledge Supremacy
[00:12:59] is going to be the big fight right so
[00:13:01] the US government banned essentially the
[00:13:02] Invidia chips although they weren&#39;t
[00:13:03] allowed to say that was what they were
[00:13:04] doing but they actually did that into
[00:13:05] China um they have about a 10year chip
[00:13:08] advant we have a roughly 10e chip
[00:13:09] advantage in terms of subdv is sub five
[00:13:12] roughly 10 years wow um and so you&#39;re
[00:13:14] gonna have so an example would be today
[00:13:16] we&#39;re a couple of years ahead of China
[00:13:17] my guess is we&#39;ll get a few more years
[00:13:18] ahead of China and the Chinese are
[00:13:20] whopping mad about this it&#39;s like hugely
[00:13:21] upset about it so that&#39;s a big deal that
[00:13:23] was a decision made by the Trump
[00:13:24] Administration and furthered by the
[00:13:25] Biden Administration do you think that
[00:13:27] it&#39;s going to make that scale of
[00:13:28] investment I mean OB the chips act but
[00:13:29] beyond that build building a massive AI
[00:13:32] system so so as you know I I lead a an
[00:13:34] informal ad hoc non-legal group that&#39;s
[00:13:37] that&#39;s different from illegal exactly
[00:13:39] justar which includes all the usual
[00:13:41] which includes all The Usual Suspects
[00:13:43] yes and The Usual Suspects over the last
[00:13:44] year came up with basis of the reasoning
[00:13:46] that became the um uh uh the B
[00:13:49] administration&#39;s uh AI act which is the
[00:13:51] longest Presidential Directive in
[00:13:53] history you&#39;re talking the special
[00:13:53] competitive studies Pro no this is the
[00:13:55] actual the actual act from the executive
[00:13:58] office and there implementing the
[00:13:59] details so far they&#39;ve got it right and
[00:14:01] so for example one of the debates that
[00:14:02] we had for last year has been how do you
[00:14:05] detect danger in a system which has
[00:14:07] learned it but you don&#39;t know what to
[00:14:09] ask it okay so in other words it&#39;s a
[00:14:11] core it&#39;s a sort of a core problem it&#39;s
[00:14:12] learned something bad but it can&#39;t tell
[00:14:14] you what it learned and you don&#39;t know
[00:14:15] what to ask it and there&#39;s so many
[00:14:16] threats right like it learned how to mix
[00:14:18] chemistry in some new way but you don&#39;t
[00:14:19] know how to ask it and so people are
[00:14:21] working hard on that but we ultimately
[00:14:22] wrote in our memos to them that there
[00:14:24] was a threshold which we arbitrarily
[00:14:25] named as 10 to the 26 flops which
[00:14:27] technically is a measure of computation
[00:14:29] that that threshold you had to report to
[00:14:31] the government that you were doing this
[00:14:32] and that&#39;s part of the rule the EU to
[00:14:35] just make sure they were different did
[00:14:36] 10 to 25 yeah but it&#39;s all kind of close
[00:14:38] enough I think all of these distinctions
[00:14:39] go away because the technology will now
[00:14:41] the technical term is called Federated
[00:14:42] training where basically you can take
[00:14:43] pieces and Union them together so we may
[00:14:46] not be able to keep keep people safe
[00:14:48] from these new things well rumors are
[00:14:49] that that&#39;s how open ey has had to train
[00:14:50] partly because of the power uh
[00:14:51] consumption there&#39;s no one place where
[00:14:53] so this is interesting I haven&#39;t heard
[00:14:55] that specific terminology before so he&#39;s
[00:14:57] saying that you can kind of build
[00:14:58] different pie pieces of LMS or sort of
[00:15:00] AI systems you train those pieces
[00:15:02] separately and then you Union them
[00:15:05] together you glue them together we&#39;ve
[00:15:06] seen this with the recent paper
[00:15:08] published where you can take sort of the
[00:15:09] large smart model and a very like a
[00:15:11] cheaper faster model and have sort of
[00:15:14] another sort of gatekeeper another yet
[00:15:16] another a model that kind of chooses
[00:15:17] where it routes the questions to so
[00:15:20] certain questions need to be answered by
[00:15:21] the bigger model but there&#39;s a lot that
[00:15:23] can be answered just as effectively by
[00:15:26] the smaller model and so this model just
[00:15:27] routes them to the cheaper model when
[00:15:29] needed and the results have been
[00:15:31] astonishing because it&#39;s if I remember
[00:15:33] my numbers correctly it has shown in
[00:15:35] some cases to reduce the cost of running
[00:15:37] these things by 80% while maintaining
[00:15:40] something like 96% accuracy so for just
[00:15:43] and I don&#39;t recall those the exact
[00:15:45] numbers but it was some big big numbers
[00:15:46] like that so it&#39;s a tiny reduction in
[00:15:48] accuracy for a potentially massive
[00:15:51] reduction in cost so I&#39;m not sure if
[00:15:53] that&#39;s an example of specifically what
[00:15:55] he&#39;s talking about but this idea of
[00:15:56] Federated training sounds like it&#39;s
[00:15:58] training piece in individual sort of
[00:16:00] batches right and taking those pieces
[00:16:02] and then putting them together to create
[00:16:04] the final model next they&#39;re talking
[00:16:06] about war well let&#39;s talk to about a
[00:16:08] real war that&#39;s going on I know that uh
[00:16:10] something you&#39;ve been very involved in
[00:16:11] is uh the Ukraine war and in particular
[00:16:15] uh I know that uh something you&#39;ve been
[00:16:17] very involved in is uh the Ukraine war
[00:16:19] and in particular uh I how you talk
[00:16:21] about white stor and your your goal of
[00:16:23] having a 500,000 $500 drones destroy $5
[00:16:26] million tanks so Howes that changing
[00:16:28] Warfare I work for the Secretary of
[00:16:29] Defense for seven years and and tried to
[00:16:32] change the way we run our military I&#39;m
[00:16:34] I&#39;m not a particularly big fan of the
[00:16:35] military but it&#39;s very expensive and I
[00:16:36] wanted to see if I could be helpful and
[00:16:37] I think in my view I largely failed they
[00:16:38] gave me a medal so they must give medals
[00:16:41] to failure or you know whatever but my
[00:16:43] self-criticism was nothing has really
[00:16:44] changed and the system in America is not
[00:16:47] going to lead to real Innovation so
[00:16:49] watching the Russians use tanks to
[00:16:51] destroy apartment buildings with little
[00:16:52] old ladies and kids just drove me crazy
[00:16:54] so I decided to work on a company with
[00:16:55] your friend Sebastian thrun and as a
[00:16:57] former faculty member here and a bunch
[00:16:59] of Stanford people and the idea
[00:17:01] basically is to do two things use AI in
[00:17:03] complicated powerful ways for these
[00:17:04] essentially robotic War and the second
[00:17:06] one is to lower the cost of the robots
[00:17:07] now you sit there and you go why would a
[00:17:09] good liberal like me do that and the
[00:17:10] answer is that the whole theory of
[00:17:13] armies is tanks artilleries and Mort and
[00:17:15] we can eliminate all of them and we can
[00:17:17] make the penalty for invading a country
[00:17:18] at least by lamb essentially being
[00:17:20] impossible it should eliminate the kind
[00:17:22] of land battles well this this is Rel
[00:17:23] question is that does it give more of
[00:17:25] advantage to defense versus offense can
[00:17:26] you can you even make that distinction
[00:17:27] because I&#39;ve been doing this for the
[00:17:28] last year I&#39;ve learned a lot about war
[00:17:29] that I really did not want to know and
[00:17:31] one of the things to know about war is
[00:17:32] that the offense always has the
[00:17:33] advantage because you can always
[00:17:35] overwhelm the defensive systems and so
[00:17:37] you&#39;re better off as a strategy of
[00:17:38] National Defense to have a very strong
[00:17:40] offense that you can use if you need to
[00:17:42] and the systems that I and others are
[00:17:43] building will do that um because of the
[00:17:45] way the system works I now a licensed I
[00:17:47] think he might have misspoken there let
[00:17:48] me know in the comments if you think so
[00:17:50] too or I&#39;m missing something I think he
[00:17:52] meant to say that he will he and others
[00:17:54] like him will build incredible defensive
[00:17:57] systems to reduce the effectiveness of
[00:17:59] invading and using offensive systems
[00:18:01] that&#39;s how I&#39;m interpreting I think he
[00:18:03] kind of to me it sounds like he misspoke
[00:18:04] a little bit if if I understand
[00:18:05] correctly because of the way the system
[00:18:07] works I am now a licensed arms deer
[00:18:10] others are building we do that um
[00:18:11] because of the way the system works I am
[00:18:13] now a licensed arms dealer so computer
[00:18:15] scientist businessman arms dealer and
[00:18:19] I&#39;m sorry to agression I I don&#39;t know I
[00:18:21] do not recommend this in your Carew I
[00:18:22] stick with they are um and because of
[00:18:24] the way the laws work um we&#39;re doing
[00:18:25] this privately and then it&#39;s this is all
[00:18:27] legal with the support of the
[00:18:28] governments it goes straight into
[00:18:28] Ukraine and then they fight the war and
[00:18:30] and and without going into all the
[00:18:31] details things are pretty bad I think if
[00:18:33] in May or June if the Russians build up
[00:18:36] as they expecting to Ukraine will lose a
[00:18:38] whole chunk of its territory and will
[00:18:39] begin the process of losing the whole
[00:18:40] country so I believe this was recorded
[00:18:42] in August 2024 just a few days ago or at
[00:18:45] least that&#39;s when it was posted if you
[00:18:47] recall the news headlines about it all
[00:18:49] of them are from like a few hours ago so
[00:18:51] I think he&#39;s talking about 2025 I&#39;m
[00:18:54] assuming so he&#39;s talking about May or
[00:18:55] June of 2025 for most of History humans
[00:18:58] sort of had a mystical understanding of
[00:18:59] the universe and then there&#39;s the
[00:19:00] Scientific Revolution and the
[00:19:01] enlightenment um and in your article you
[00:19:03] argue that now these models are becoming
[00:19:05] so complicated and uh difficult to
[00:19:08] understand that we don&#39;t really know
[00:19:09] what&#39;s going on in them I&#39;ll take a
[00:19:11] quote from Richard fean he says what I
[00:19:12] cannot create I do not understand I saw
[00:19:13] this quote the other day but now people
[00:19:15] are creating things they do not that
[00:19:16] that they can create but they don&#39;t
[00:19:16] really understand what&#39;s inside of them
[00:19:17] is the nature of knowledge changing in a
[00:19:19] way are we gonna have to start just
[00:19:20] taking the word for these models without
[00:19:22] them able being able to explain it to us
[00:19:23] the analogy I would offer is to
[00:19:24] teenagers if you have a teenager you
[00:19:26] know that they&#39;re human but you can&#39;t
[00:19:27] quite figure out what they&#39;re thinking
[00:19:29] um but somehow we&#39;ve managed in society
[00:19:30] to adapt to the presence of teenagers
[00:19:32] right and they eventually grow out of
[00:19:33] that and this serious so it&#39;s probably
[00:19:35] the case we&#39;re going to have knowledge
[00:19:37] systems that we cannot fully
[00:19:38] characterize but we understand their
[00:19:40] boundaries right we understand the
[00:19:42] limits of what they can do and that&#39;s
[00:19:43] probably the best outcome we can get do
[00:19:44] you think we&#39;ll understand the limits we
[00:19:46] we&#39;ll get pretty good at it the
[00:19:47] consensus of my group that meets on
[00:19:49] every week is that eventually the way
[00:19:51] you&#39;ll do this it&#39;s called SOC called
[00:19:52] adversarial AI is that there will there
[00:19:54] will actually be companies that you will
[00:19:56] hire and pay money to to break your AI
[00:19:58] system so it&#39;ll be the r instead of
[00:19:59] human red teams which is what they do
[00:20:00] today you&#39;ll have whole companies and a
[00:20:02] whole industry of AI systems whose jobs
[00:20:04] are to break the existing AI systems and
[00:20:05] find their vulnerabilities especially
[00:20:07] the knowledge that they have that we
[00:20:08] can&#39;t figure out that makes sense to me
[00:20:09] it&#39;s also a great project for you here
[00:20:11] at Stanford because if you have a
[00:20:12] graduate student who has to figure out
[00:20:13] how to attack one of these large models
[00:20:15] and understand what it does that is a
[00:20:16] great skill to build the Next Generation
[00:20:18] so it makes sense to me that the two
[00:20:19] will travel together if that&#39;s something
[00:20:21] that interests you there&#39;s a Twitter SLX
[00:20:23] account Pini The prompter Who uh
[00:20:25] basically jailbreaks a lot of these
[00:20:27] models usually within a few days of
[00:20:28] their release so he&#39;s just of course one
[00:20:30] of uh many people that do sort of things
[00:20:33] like that he does it kind of simly for
[00:20:35] entertainment and for online media
[00:20:38] Clouts but if you think about it third
[00:20:40] party testing third party red teaming of
[00:20:43] AI models third party quality assurance
[00:20:45] right QA of these models as they roll
[00:20:48] out and have contact with consumers with
[00:20:50] businesses with organizations Etc as
[00:20:52] well as just with various infrastructure
[00:20:54] systems and factories automations Etc
[00:20:57] war of course that&#39;s going to be a Big
[00:20:58] Industry that doesn&#39;t really exist yet
[00:21:01] it it just is beginning to grow and yet
[00:21:04] that might be something interesting and
[00:21:06] profitable to get into if that&#39;s uh
[00:21:08] that&#39;s your cup of tea next he comments
[00:21:10] just a bit on adver serial AI you just
[00:21:13] mentioned adversarial I&#39;m wonder if
[00:21:15] elaborate on that more it seems to be
[00:21:16] besides obviously increase get more
[00:21:18] perform mod getting them to do what you
[00:21:20] want
[00:21:22] isue well you have to assume that the
[00:21:24] current hallucination problems become
[00:21:26] less right in as the technology gets
[00:21:28] better and so forth I&#39;m not suggesting
[00:21:29] it goes away and then you also have to
[00:21:31] assume that there are tests for efficacy
[00:21:33] so there has to be a way of knowing that
[00:21:34] the thing succeeded so in the example
[00:21:36] that I gave of the Tik Tok competitor
[00:21:37] and by the way I was not arguing that
[00:21:38] you should illegally steal everybody&#39;s
[00:21:39] music what you would do if you&#39;re a
[00:21:40] silicon value entrepreneur which
[00:21:41] hopefully all of you will be is if it
[00:21:43] took off then you&#39;d hire a whole bunch
[00:21:44] of lawyers to go clean the mess up right
[00:21:45] but if if nobody uses your product it
[00:21:47] doesn&#39;t matter that you stole all the
[00:21:48] content and do not quote me right right
[00:21:51] you&#39;re on camera that&#39;s right but you
[00:21:53] see my point in other words Silicon
[00:21:54] Valley will run these tests and clean up
[00:21:55] the mess and that&#39;s typically how those
[00:21:56] things are done so so my own View is
[00:21:58] that you&#39;ll see more and more um
[00:22:00] performative systems with even better
[00:22:02] test and eventually adversarial tests
[00:22:03] and that&#39;ll keep it within a box the
[00:22:05] technical term is called Chain of
[00:22:06] Thought reasoning and people believe
[00:22:07] that in the next few years you&#39;ll be
[00:22:09] able to generate a thousand steps of
[00:22:10] Chain of Thought reasoning right do this
[00:22:12] do this it&#39;s like building recipes right
[00:22:13] that the recipes you can run the recipe
[00:22:15] and you can actually test that It
[00:22:16] produced the correct outcome and that&#39;s
[00:22:17] how the system will work next they ask
[00:22:19] what&#39;s going to be driving AI progress
[00:22:20] is it more data more compute is it just
[00:22:23] like chips and Hardware the amounts of
[00:22:24] money being thrown around are
[00:22:26] mindboggling and um I&#39;ve chose I
[00:22:29] essentially invest in everything because
[00:22:30] I can&#39;t figure out who&#39;s going to win
[00:22:31] and the amounts of money that are
[00:22:33] following me are so large I think some
[00:22:35] of it is because the early money has
[00:22:36] been made and the big money people who
[00:22:37] don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing have to
[00:22:38] have an AI component and everything is
[00:22:40] now an AI investment so they can&#39;t tell
[00:22:41] the difference I Define ai as Learning
[00:22:43] Systems systems that actually learn so I
[00:22:44] think that&#39;s one of them the second is
[00:22:46] that there are very sophisticated new
[00:22:47] algorithms that are sort of post
[00:22:48] Transformers my friend my collaborator
[00:22:50] for a long time has invented a new non-
[00:22:51] Transformer architecture there&#39;s a group
[00:22:53] that I&#39;m funding in Paris that has
[00:22:54] claims to done the same thing so there&#39;s
[00:22:56] enormous invention there a lot of things
[00:22:57] at Stanford and the final thing is that
[00:22:59] there is a belief in the market that the
[00:23:01] invention of intelligence has infinite
[00:23:03] return so let&#39;s say you have you put $50
[00:23:05] billion of capital into a company you
[00:23:07] have to make an awful lot of money from
[00:23:08] intelligence to pay that back I mean
[00:23:10] when you phrase it like that it seems to
[00:23:11] make sense if you invent intelligence
[00:23:14] certainly that would have an infinite
[00:23:17] return so it&#39;s probably the case that
[00:23:18] we&#39;ll go through some huge investment
[00:23:20] bubble and then it&#39;ll sort itself out
[00:23:21] that&#39;s always been true in the past and
[00:23:23] it&#39;s likely to be true here and what you
[00:23:24] said earlier was you think that the
[00:23:26] leaders are pulling away from right now
[00:23:27] right now and and
[00:23:29] this is a really the question is roughly
[00:23:31] the following there&#39;s a company called
[00:23:32] mrr in France they done a really good
[00:23:34] job um and I&#39;m obviously an investor um
[00:23:36] they have produced their second version
[00:23:38] their third model is likely to be closed
[00:23:39] because it&#39;s so expensive they need
[00:23:41] revenue and they can&#39;t give their model
[00:23:42] away so this open source versus closed
[00:23:44] Source debate in our industry is huge
[00:23:46] and um my entire career was based on
[00:23:49] people being willing to share software
[00:23:50] in open source everything about me is
[00:23:52] open source much of Google&#39;s
[00:23:53] underpinnings were open source
[00:23:54] everything I&#39;ve done technically and yet
[00:23:56] it may be that the capital costs which
[00:23:57] are so immense fundamentally changes how
[00:23:59] software is built you and I were talking
[00:24:01] um my own view of software programmers
[00:24:03] is that software programmers
[00:24:04] productivity will at least double there
[00:24:05] are three or four software companies
[00:24:07] that are trying to do that I&#39;ve invested
[00:24:08] in all of them in and they&#39;re all trying
[00:24:10] to make software programmers more
[00:24:11] productive the most interesting one that
[00:24:12] I just met with is called augment and I
[00:24:14] always think of an individual programmer
[00:24:15] and they said that&#39;s not our Target our
[00:24:16] Target are these 100 person software
[00:24:17] programming teams on millions of lines
[00:24:19] of code where nobody knows what&#39;s going
[00:24:20] on that&#39;s a really good AI thing will
[00:24:22] they make money I hope so you mentioned
[00:24:24] that there&#39;s the combination of the
[00:24:25] context exension the agents and the text
[00:24:27] to action is going to unimaginable
[00:24:29] impacts first of all why is the
[00:24:31] combination important and second of all
[00:24:32] I know that you know you&#39;re not like a
[00:24:33] crystal ball and you can&#39;t necessarily
[00:24:35] tell the future but why do you think
[00:24:36] it&#39;s beyond anything that we could
[00:24:37] imagine I think largely because the
[00:24:38] context window allows you to solve the
[00:24:40] problem of recency the current models
[00:24:42] take a year to train roughly six six
[00:24:44] there 18 months six months of
[00:24:45] preparation six months of training six
[00:24:46] months of fine tuning so they&#39;re always
[00:24:47] out of date context window you can feed
[00:24:50] what happened like you can ask it
[00:24:51] questions about the uh the Hamas Israel
[00:24:53] war right in a context that&#39;s very
[00:24:55] powerful it becomes current like Google
[00:24:56] um in the case of Agents I&#39;ll give you
[00:24:58] an example I set up a foundation which
[00:24:59] is funding a nonprofit which starts
[00:25:01] there&#39;s a I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s
[00:25:02] Chemists in the room that I don&#39;t really
[00:25:03] understand chemistry there&#39;s a a tool
[00:25:05] called chro CW which was an LM based
[00:25:08] system that learned chemistry and what
[00:25:09] they do is they run it to generate
[00:25:10] chemistry hypotheses about proteins and
[00:25:12] they have a lab which runs the tests
[00:25:14] overnight and then it learns that&#39;s a
[00:25:16] huge acceleration accelerant in
[00:25:17] chemistry Material Science and so forth
[00:25:19] so that&#39;s that&#39;s an agent model and I
[00:25:21] think the text to action can be
[00:25:21] understood by just having a lot of sheet
[00:25:23] programmers right um and I don&#39;t think
[00:25:25] we understand what happens and this is
[00:25:26] again your area of expertise what happen
[00:25:28] happens when everyone has their own
[00:25:29] programmer I&#39;m not talking about turning
[00:25:30] on and off the lights you know I imagine
[00:25:32] another example um for some reason you
[00:25:34] don&#39;t like Google so you say build me a
[00:25:35] Google competitor yeah you personally
[00:25:37] you don&#39;t build me a Google competitor
[00:25:38] uh search the web build a UI make a good
[00:25:41] copy um add generative AI in an
[00:25:43] interesting way do it in 30 seconds and
[00:25:45] see if it works right so a lot of people
[00:25:49] believe that the incumbents including
[00:25:50] Google are vulnerable to this kind of an
[00:25:52] attack now we&#39;ll see there were a bunch
[00:25:53] of questions who were sent over by
[00:25:54] slider I want to give some of them
[00:25:55] upload so um here&#39;s one um we talked a
[00:25:57] little about this last year um how can
[00:25:58] we stop AI from influencing public
[00:25:59] opinion misinformation especially during
[00:26:00] the upcoming he&#39;s asked a bit about
[00:26:02] misinformation how can we prevent AI
[00:26:05] from causing misinformation he talks
[00:26:07] about how during his time working with
[00:26:08] YouTube that was a problem people would
[00:26:10] upload a video for profit for their own
[00:26:13] self-gain and as a result of
[00:26:15] misinformation he says well people could
[00:26:17] be hurt he even says people die so
[00:26:19] certainly that is a problem if you saw
[00:26:22] my yesterday&#39;s video about grock 2 and
[00:26:24] the images it generates they&#39;re very re
[00:26:26] looking and grock 2 does not seem to
[00:26:29] have any sort of safety rails in place
[00:26:31] it just generates whatever you ask for
[00:26:33] so heading into the selection certainly
[00:26:35] that could be an issue he talks a little
[00:26:37] bit about some sort of a digital
[00:26:38] authentication or a public key
[00:26:40] authentication basically if somebody
[00:26:42] like the president speaks there&#39;s some
[00:26:44] key that everybody else can verify
[00:26:46] saying okay this is him this is his
[00:26:48] original audio he mentions briefly that
[00:26:50] it&#39;s it seems like he&#39;s saying it&#39;s a
[00:26:51] shame that the American universities
[00:26:53] aren&#39;t getting as much resources for
[00:26:56] computes for Google cloud and other
[00:26:58] places like that and this explosion
[00:27:00] where all the big companies are
[00:27:01] basically gobbling up the available
[00:27:03] resources and so he&#39;s saying the right
[00:27:05] thing for us to do is to get them the
[00:27:07] resources they need to give the
[00:27:08] universities the compute the resources
[00:27:10] that they need to pursue research and
[00:27:12] development and all that stuff next they
[00:27:13] talk about automation who&#39;s getting
[00:27:15] replaced who&#39;s getting to be obsolete in
[00:27:18] the labor force so let&#39;s take a look at
[00:27:20] that really fast I&#39;ll defer to the real
[00:27:22] expert here uh as your amateur Economist
[00:27:24] taught by Eric um I I fundamentally
[00:27:27] believe that the the sort of college
[00:27:28] education High skills task will be fine
[00:27:30] because people will work with these
[00:27:31] systems I think the systems is no
[00:27:33] different from any other technology wave
[00:27:34] the dangerous jobs and the jobs which
[00:27:35] require very little human judgment will
[00:27:37] get replaced the next question is kind
[00:27:39] of like the global balance of AI power
[00:27:42] so the person asking the question
[00:27:43] specifically mentions us and China but
[00:27:46] as you see here Eric specifically
[00:27:48] focuses on India take a listen the most
[00:27:50] interesting country is India because the
[00:27:52] top AI people come from India to the us
[00:27:54] and we should let India keep some of its
[00:27:56] top talent not all of them but some of
[00:27:57] them um and they don&#39;t have the kind of
[00:27:58] training facilities and programs that we
[00:28:00] so richly have here to me India is the
[00:28:01] big swing state in that regard China&#39;s
[00:28:03] Lost it&#39;s not going to not going to come
[00:28:04] back they&#39;re not going to change the
[00:28:05] regime as much as people wish them to do
[00:28:07] Japan and Korea are clearly in our camp
[00:28:09] Taiwan is a fantastic country whose
[00:28:11] software is terrible so that&#39;s not gonna
[00:28:12] going to work um amazing hard and in the
[00:28:15] rest of the world there are not a lot of
[00:28:16] other good choices that are big German
[00:28:18] the Europe is screwed up because of
[00:28:19] Brussels it&#39;s not a new fact I spent 10
[00:28:20] years fighting them and I work really
[00:28:22] hard to get them to fix the the EU act
[00:28:24] and they still have all the restrictions
[00:28:26] that make it very difficult to do our
[00:28:27] kind of research in Europe my French
[00:28:28] friends have spent all their time
[00:28:29] battling Brussels and mcon who&#39;s a
[00:28:31] personal friend is fighting hard for
[00:28:33] this and so France I think has a chance
[00:28:34] I don&#39;t see I don&#39;t see Germany coming
[00:28:35] and the rest is not big
[00:28:36] enough yes ma&#39;am so I know you&#39;re an
[00:28:39] engineer by
[00:28:40] trainer um given the capabilities that
[00:28:43] you Enis these mod should we still spend
[00:28:44] Hing to yeah because because ultimately
[00:28:46] it&#39;s it&#39;s the old thing of why do you
[00:28:47] study English if you can speak English
[00:28:49] you get better at it right you really do
[00:28:50] need to understand how these systems
[00:28:51] work and I feel very strong yes sir yeah
[00:28:53] I&#39;m curious if you explore good answer
[00:28:55] distributed setting and I&#39;m asking
[00:28:56] because sure like making a large cluster
[00:28:58] but Ma are powerful there&#39;s a lot of
[00:28:59] small maches across the world so like
[00:29:01] you think like folding at home are a
[00:29:02] similar idea works for training yeah we
[00:29:04] look very hard this so the way the
[00:29:06] algorithms work is you have a very large
[00:29:07] Matrix and you have essentially a
[00:29:08] multiplication function so think of it
[00:29:10] as going back and forth and back and
[00:29:12] forth and these systems are completely
[00:29:13] limited by the speed of memory to CPU or
[00:29:15] GPU and in fact the next iteration of
[00:29:18] Nvidia chips has combined all those
[00:29:20] functions into one chip the chips are
[00:29:21] now so big that they glue them all
[00:29:22] together and in fact the package is so
[00:29:24] sensitive the package is put together in
[00:29:26] a clean room as well as the chip itself
[00:29:27] so the looks like supercomputers and
[00:29:29] speed of light especially memory
[00:29:31] interconnect really dominated so I think
[00:29:32] unlikely for a while is there a way to
[00:29:33] segment the element like so Jeff de last
[00:29:35] year when he spoke here talked about
[00:29:36] having these different parts of it you
[00:29:38] train separately and then kind of
[00:29:39] Federate them each you know in order to
[00:29:41] do that you&#39;d have to have 10 million
[00:29:42] such things and then you&#39;re the way you
[00:29:44] ask the questions would be too slow he&#39;s
[00:29:45] talking about eight or 10 12 not at Lev
[00:29:49] the back way back I know like after
[00:29:51] releas new yor time open using work for
[00:29:53] training do you think
[00:29:54] that&#39;s I used to do a lot of work on the
[00:29:56] music licensing stuff what I learned was
[00:29:58] that in the 60s there was a series of
[00:30:00] lawsuits that resulted in an agreement
[00:30:02] where you get a a stipulated royalty
[00:30:04] whenever your song is played even even
[00:30:06] they don&#39;t even know who you are so paid
[00:30:07] into a bank and my guess is it&#39;ll be the
[00:30:08] same thing there be lots of lawsuits and
[00:30:09] there&#39;ll be some kind of stipulated
[00:30:10] agreement which will just say you have
[00:30:12] to pay x per of whatever Revenue you
[00:30:14] have in order to use pass cap BMI cap
[00:30:16] BMI look them up it&#39;s long it will seem
[00:30:17] very old to you but I think that&#39;s how
[00:30:18] it will yes sir interesting like there&#39;s
[00:30:21] a few players that are dominating AI
[00:30:23] right they&#39;ll continue to dominate and
[00:30:24] they seem to overlap with the large
[00:30:25] companies that all the antitrust
[00:30:27] regulation is kind of focus on how do
[00:30:28] you see those two Trends kind of yeah
[00:30:30] like do you see Regulators breaking up
[00:30:31] these companies and how will that affect
[00:30:33] the yeah so in my career I helped
[00:30:36] Microsoft get broken up and it wasn&#39;t
[00:30:37] broken up and I fought fought for Google
[00:30:39] to not be broken up and it&#39;s not been
[00:30:40] broken up so it sure looks to me like
[00:30:41] the trend is not to be broken up um as
[00:30:43] long as the companies avoid being John D
[00:30:45] Rockefeller the senior and I studied
[00:30:46] this looked it up it&#39;s how antitrust law
[00:30:48] came I don&#39;t think the government is
[00:30:49] will act the re the reason you&#39;re seeing
[00:30:51] these large companies dominate is who
[00:30:52] has the capital to build these data
[00:30:54] centers right right so my friend Reed
[00:30:56] and my friend com
[00:30:58] two have we talked to you about the
[00:31:00] decision that they made to take
[00:31:01] inflection so I believe Mustafa he&#39;s
[00:31:02] talking about Mustafa siman who is the
[00:31:04] co-founder of Google Deep Mind friend
[00:31:06] Reed and my friend M coming next we two
[00:31:08] week have Reed talked to you about the
[00:31:10] decision that they made to take
[00:31:11] inflection and essentially PE part it
[00:31:12] into Microsoft basically they decided
[00:31:14] they couldn&#39;t raise the tens of billions
[00:31:15] of dollars is that number public that
[00:31:16] you mentioned earlier have
[00:31:18] have
[00:31:20] got we want
[00:31:24] this I was wondering where all this is
[00:31:26] going to leave countries where in b
[00:31:27] ipants in phun models and access to
[00:31:30] compu the rich get richer and the poor
[00:31:32] do the best they can um they&#39;ll have to
[00:31:34] the fact of the matter is this is a rich
[00:31:36] country&#39;s game right huge Capital lots
[00:31:38] of technically strong people strong
[00:31:39] government support right there are two
[00:31:41] examples there lots of other countries
[00:31:43] that have all sorts of problems they
[00:31:43] don&#39;t have those resources they&#39;ll have
[00:31:44] to find a partner they&#39;ll have to join
[00:31:46] with somebody else something like that I
[00:31:48] last we met you he&#39;s fairly blunt he&#39;s
[00:31:50] fairly straightforward he I think kind
[00:31:52] of calls it how he sees it and it really
[00:31:55] seems like he&#39;s not talking one side or
[00:31:56] the other he doesn&#39;t have he&#39;s not
[00:31:58] pumping his back so to speak so he&#39;s not
[00:32:00] saying the things that benefit his
[00:32:01] portfolio or whatever he&#39;s just like
[00:32:03] yeah this is how it&#39;s going to be this
[00:32:04] is how it works by default big companies
[00:32:06] are not going to broken up the rich get
[00:32:07] richer Etc and finally he&#39;s asked a
[00:32:10] little bit more about kind of the
[00:32:11] business and entrepreneur side of things
[00:32:13] if you&#39;re starting your own company you
[00:32:15] have a product idea what does that look
[00:32:16] like how do you develop it how do you
[00:32:18] create a lot of wealth with your own
[00:32:20] product here&#39;s his answer I want I think
[00:32:23] the last we met you you at hackathon at
[00:32:24] AGI house and I know you spent a lot of
[00:32:26] time helping like young people as they
[00:32:27] create a lot of wealth and you spoke
[00:32:28] very passionately about about wanting to
[00:32:30] to do that do you have any advice for
[00:32:31] folks here as they&#39;re building their
[00:32:32] they&#39;re writing their business PL for
[00:32:33] this class or policy proposals or
[00:32:34] research proposals um you know at this
[00:32:36] stage of the careers going forward well
[00:32:39] um I teach a class in the business
[00:32:40] school on this so you should come to my
[00:32:41] class um the I am struck by the speed
[00:32:44] which with which you can build
[00:32:46] demonstrations of new ideas so in that
[00:32:49] in one of the hack I did the winning
[00:32:51] team the command was fly the Drone
[00:32:53] between two towers and it was given a
[00:32:54] virtual drone space and it figured out
[00:32:56] how to fly the Drone what the word
[00:32:57] between them generated the code in
[00:32:58] Python and flew the Drone in the
[00:32:59] simulator through the tower I just it
[00:33:01] would have taken a week or two you know
[00:33:03] good professional programmers to do that
[00:33:05] um I&#39;m telling you that the ability to
[00:33:06] prototype quickly really you know part
[00:33:08] part of the problem being an
[00:33:09] entrepreneur is everything happens
[00:33:10] faster well now if you can&#39;t get your
[00:33:12] prototype built in a day using these
[00:33:14] various tools you need to think about
[00:33:16] that right because that&#39;s who your
[00:33:17] competitor is doing so I guess my
[00:33:18] biggest advice is when you start
[00:33:19] thinking about a company is find the
[00:33:20] right a business CL plan in fact you
[00:33:22] should ask the computer to write your
[00:33:23] business plan for you
[00:33:25] um talk about that after leave it and
[00:33:28] and but I think it&#39;s very important to
[00:33:30] prototype your idea using these tools as
[00:33:32] quickly as you can because you can be
[00:33:33] sure there&#39;s another person doing
[00:33:34] exactly that same thing in another
[00:33:36] company in another University in a place
[00:33:38] that You&#39; all right
[00:33:40] thank very cool so this piece was uh
[00:33:43] taken down so apparently it&#39;s not even
[00:33:44] online right now but hopefully those few
[00:33:47] little Clips give you glips about what
[00:33:49] he thinks of AI you know I&#39;ve kind of
[00:33:51] cut out all the pieces that I think
[00:33:53] caused the controversy or whatever that
[00:33:55] situation was I don&#39;t think it really
[00:33:56] had anything to do with AI or anything
[00:33:58] of of substance I mean maybe touched on
[00:34:01] some political issues but whatever this
[00:34:03] is a person with a lot of really
[00:34:05] technical background and even though
[00:34:07] he&#39;s more of like a business guy he is
[00:34:10] spoken of with a lot of respect by all
[00:34:12] the engineers and all the very highly
[00:34:14] technical people in the Bay Area in the
[00:34:16] Silicon Valley he&#39;s somebody that really
[00:34:17] understands the tech space looks like
[00:34:19] Forbes has him listed as having a netw
[00:34:21] worth of almost $24 billion he&#39;s good
[00:34:25] friends he said with Sam Alman president
[00:34:27] of France France sounds like he knows
[00:34:29] all the co-founders of various AI
[00:34:31] companies big and small I mean this is
[00:34:33] somebody that&#39;s very very on the inside
[00:34:35] this is somebody that knows where things
[00:34:37] are going so certainly when he says
[00:34:39] something I tend to listen I put a great
[00:34:41] deal of weight into what he&#39;s saying and
[00:34:43] what he&#39;s saying is this AI wave is just
[00:34:47] starting we have two massive countries
[00:34:49] two big countries with the capital and
[00:34:50] the talent and everything else that&#39;s
[00:34:52] needed that are vying for AI Supremacy
[00:34:54] the issues with the chips and the power
[00:34:56] and the data while those are bottlenecks
[00:34:59] it seems like they will slowly be
[00:35:01] perhaps even maybe not that slowly
[00:35:03] slowly but but be improved you mentioned
[00:35:05] building data centers and various other
[00:35:07] AI infrastructure in Canada potentially
[00:35:10] which makes a lot of sense if you think
[00:35:12] about it lots of open land tends to be
[00:35:14] colder which again you know Heating and
[00:35:17] the generation of heat and having to
[00:35:19] cool these facilities is a concern tons
[00:35:22] land very friendly government to the US
[00:35:24] you know in factorio how do you just
[00:35:26] like find a big chunk of the map where
[00:35:28] there&#39;s a lot of open land and you&#39;d
[00:35:30] build all your nuclear power plants
[00:35:32] you&#39;d build out your entire like
[00:35:34] electricity infrastructure there just
[00:35:36] have a cable going back to where you
[00:35:38] need electricity to be it begs the
[00:35:40] question is this the future of Canada
[00:35:42] I&#39;m only kidding of course folks but the
[00:35:45] more and more I think about it there is
[00:35:46] a lot of land it&#39;s close by and it&#39;s
[00:35:49] cold and certainly that would be
[00:35:51] phenomenal for the revenue of Canada to
[00:35:53] generate some sort of tax some sort of
[00:35:55] Revenue based on right one of the kind
[00:35:57] of superpowers building out the
[00:35:59] infrastructure it needs to stay dominant
[00:36:01] in the AI race right I mean they&#39;re
[00:36:03] talking about creating 100 billion doll
[00:36:06] data centers potentially even the
[00:36:08] estimates a size 300 billion so that&#39;s
[00:36:10] that&#39;s one company that&#39;s not even the
[00:36:12] US government supported projects that&#39;s
[00:36:15] just a publicly traded company doing
[00:36:17] that sounds like he&#39;s really believing
[00:36:19] in Nvidia and the power of Nvidia and
[00:36:21] it&#39;s Cuda sort of software that the
[00:36:24] chips run on and if I&#39;m understanding
[00:36:26] him correctly he&#39;s not really seeing any
[00:36:28] competition to that I mean there&#39;s some
[00:36:30] things in the Horizon maybe possibly but
[00:36:32] nothing yet so it sounds like a lot of
[00:36:35] this money like a lot of it will be
[00:36:36] flowing into Nvidia and of course this
[00:36:39] idea that as the context window expands
[00:36:41] it&#39;ll become more and more sort of
[00:36:44] similar to training in a sense that
[00:36:46] right if it takes a while to train up a
[00:36:47] model but it can do in context learning
[00:36:50] meaning that you&#39;re able to just upload
[00:36:51] books and stuff to the finished model
[00:36:53] it&#39;s able to learn from them which we&#39;ve
[00:36:54] seen that with Gemini they found a
[00:36:56] language that doesn&#39;t have an a lot of
[00:36:57] online presence only something like 24
[00:37:00] people in the world speak it but they
[00:37:01] have some notebooks and manuscripts and
[00:37:03] stuff like that they uploaded to gini
[00:37:05] the actual finished trained Gemini and
[00:37:08] that model was able to learn how to
[00:37:11] speak it how to create sentences in it
[00:37:13] it wasn&#39;t trained on it it would learned
[00:37:15] in context right so as the context
[00:37:18] window ramps up to 10 million tokens
[00:37:21] that certainly seems like it would
[00:37:22] change how we think about pre- and
[00:37:25] posttraining or in other words once the
[00:37:27] model is trained it doesn&#39;t stop
[00:37:29] learning if you wanted to learn about a
[00:37:31] specific thing that you wanted to learn
[00:37:33] about maybe it&#39;s you know you have a
[00:37:34] company or that that have millions of
[00:37:37] documents and procedures and stuff like
[00:37:39] that just kind of like everywhere but no
[00:37:41] one person understands all of it well in
[00:37:43] the past that was kind of useless it
[00:37:45] doesn&#39;t really help you but if you can
[00:37:47] upload it to a model like that all of a
[00:37:49] sudden it knows all those things about
[00:37:51] your company it can train people on it
[00:37:54] it can answer your questions it can kind
[00:37:55] of manage it update see if there&#39;s any
[00:37:58] conflicts anywhere in it so instead of
[00:38:00] training a brand new model on that you
[00:38:02] just use an existing model and upload
[00:38:04] that stuff into the 10 million token
[00:38:07] context window combine that with text to
[00:38:09] action which is another word I&#39;ve heard
[00:38:11] it before this phrase but it&#39;s not that
[00:38:14] often used I feel like but yeah I mean
[00:38:16] that&#39;s what agents are basically right
[00:38:18] it&#39;s text to action you type in impr
[00:38:21] prompt and it goes and does that action
[00:38:23] it does the thing you&#39;re asking it to do
[00:38:25] as they get better at long-term plan
[00:38:27] long-term reasoning and actually Deep
[00:38:29] Mind CEO de saabi is also just had an
[00:38:32] interview talking about something very
[00:38:34] very similar he&#39;s talking about this
[00:38:36] idea that as agents become better
[00:38:38] long-term reasoners and planners they
[00:38:40] will become better and better at
[00:38:42] carrying out those long Horizon tasks
[00:38:44] and he&#39;s saying we&#39;re not ready for it
[00:38:46] when everybody can have these qualified
[00:38:49] capable agents right he&#39;s saying it&#39;s
[00:38:51] going to have an impact on the world at
[00:38:53] a scale no one understands yet and that
[00:38:56] certainly I think is true that&#39;s
[00:38:58] certainly something that I fully agree
[00:39:00] with a lot of our social structures and
[00:39:03] stuff we&#39;re kind of used to will have to
[00:39:05] change and of course he&#39;s saying if
[00:39:06] you&#39;re worried about losing your job
[00:39:08] having a degree that&#39;s going to become
[00:39:09] worthless you know should you still
[00:39:11] learn to code he&#39;s saying business as
[00:39:13] usual there yes some easy simple jobs or
[00:39:16] maybe very dangerous jobs jobs where
[00:39:18] there&#39;s not a lot of hard decisions to
[00:39:20] be made yes those might go away and yes
[00:39:23] these AIS might be pretty good at coding
[00:39:25] creating projects but learning all those
[00:39:27] skills getting better at those skills
[00:39:28] learning how everything works that&#39;s
[00:39:30] that&#39;s not going out of fashion that&#39;s
[00:39:32] never going to just disappear his
[00:39:34] example was you know if you can speak
[00:39:36] English why would you learn English
[00:39:38] right why would you study English well
[00:39:40] it&#39;s to get better at it to improve your
[00:39:42] abilities with it so I hope you enjoyed
[00:39:44] that make sure you subscribed please
[00:39:46] give me a thumbs up if you enjoyed it my
[00:39:48] name is Wes rth and I&#39;ll see you next
[00:39:49] time thank you for watching
[00:00:00] Eric Schmidt gave a facety talk at
[00:00:02] Stanford just a few days ago about AI he
[00:00:05] was of course the former Google CEO and
[00:00:08] perceived by people as a bit of a
[00:00:10] futurist he&#39;s able to kind of often very
[00:00:12] accurately predict where technology is
[00:00:14] going the interview was over an hour
[00:00:16] long and it was fascinating covering
[00:00:18] topics like ai ai agents where this
[00:00:20] whole thing is going Etc and had a lot
[00:00:22] of pretty brilliant insights by Eric
[00:00:25] into where he believes this is going but
[00:00:28] unfortunately at our plus long interview
[00:00:30] there was just one comment that people
[00:00:32] didn&#39;t like the media machine went into
[00:00:35] overdrive mode and the video has been
[00:00:38] basically taken down it&#39;s no longer
[00:00:40] available to see it was deemed too hot
[00:00:43] for the internet and no longer available
[00:00:45] but just between you and me and keep
[00:00:48] this on the DL please I might have a
[00:00:51] copy of it maybe allegedly I feel like I
[00:00:54] need to say something here that reduces
[00:00:55] my liability some sort of a legal
[00:00:58] statement like I take no resp
[00:00:59] responsibility for my actions yeah that
[00:01:01] should do subscribe for more sweet AI
[00:01:03] content let&#39;s take a look at a few clips
[00:01:05] from this Stanford lecture by Eric
[00:01:08] Schmidt about AI I think you will like
[00:01:10] it if you do hit that thumbs up please
[00:01:13] because this is somebody that has a bit
[00:01:14] of a Clairvoyance about the future of
[00:01:16] tech he tends to see how things will
[00:01:18] unfold with startling accuracy so before
[00:01:21] he starts talking he asks the class to
[00:01:23] basically Define what a context window
[00:01:25] is and what AI agents are context
[00:01:28] Windows of course you can think of it as
[00:01:29] sort of a short-term memory it&#39;s
[00:01:31] basically the amount of words that a
[00:01:33] large language model can read and also
[00:01:36] write and output and kind of interact
[00:01:38] with right so if it has a large context
[00:01:40] window you can give it a whole book and
[00:01:42] then ask it questions about the book if
[00:01:44] it has a very short context window we
[00:01:46] might start answering a question and
[00:01:47] then halfway through forget what I was
[00:01:49] talking about it would be kind of a
[00:01:50] whoops I run out of memory type of thing
[00:01:52] and AI agents are things they can sort
[00:01:55] of complete tasks on your behalf you can
[00:01:56] tell them to go order something off of
[00:01:58] Amazon they&#39;ll go they&#39;ll search they&#39;ll
[00:02:00] do reviews they&#39;ll check the sizes the
[00:02:02] colors whatever and then order it and
[00:02:04] then report that they&#39;ve done it back to
[00:02:05] you so you can think of it as kind of a
[00:02:07] smart intern that&#39;s online that&#39;s Ai and
[00:02:10] Eric is talking about potentially a
[00:02:11] seeing a 10 million token context window
[00:02:15] sometime soon potentially in next two
[00:02:17] years or so he doesn&#39;t specify a
[00:02:19] timeline but soon so the first thing he
[00:02:21] talks about is what are we going to
[00:02:23] expect to happen in the next 2 to 5
[00:02:26] years so in the short term specifically
[00:02:29] at the intersection of something like a
[00:02:31] 10 million token context window and
[00:02:33] improving autonomous AI agents take a
[00:02:35] listen so an agent is something that
[00:02:37] does that does some kind of a task
[00:02:39] another definition would be that it&#39;s an
[00:02:40] LM State and memory okay can anybody
[00:02:44] again scientist can can any of you
[00:02:45] define text action taking text and
[00:02:47] turning into an action right here go
[00:02:48] ahead yes instead of taking text and
[00:02:50] turning it into more text more text
[00:02:52] taking text and have the AI trigger
[00:02:54] actions based so another definition
[00:02:56] would be language to python a pro
[00:02:59] programming language I never wanted to
[00:03:00] see survive and and everything in AI is
[00:03:02] being done in Python there&#39;s a new
[00:03:03] language called Mojo that has just come
[00:03:05] out which looks like they finally have
[00:03:06] addressed AI programming but we&#39;ll see
[00:03:07] if that actually survives over the
[00:03:08] dominance of python um one more
[00:03:10] technical question why is NVIDIA worth2
[00:03:12] trillion doll and the other companies
[00:03:14] are struggling technical answer I mean I
[00:03:16] think it just boils down to like most of
[00:03:17] code needs to run with C optimizations
[00:03:19] that currently only support so other
[00:03:21] companies can make whatever they want to
[00:03:22] but unless they have the 10 years of
[00:03:24] software there you don&#39;t have the
[00:03:25] machine learning optimization I like to
[00:03:27] think of Cuda as the C programming
[00:03:29] language for
[00:03:30] yeah right that&#39;s the way I like to
[00:03:31] think of it was founded in 2008 I always
[00:03:32] thought it was a terrible language and
[00:03:34] yet it&#39;s become dominant there&#39;s another
[00:03:35] Insight there&#39;s a set of Open Source
[00:03:36] libraries which are highly optimized to
[00:03:38] Cuda and not anything else and everybody
[00:03:39] who builds all these Stacks right this
[00:03:41] is completely missed in any of the
[00:03:42] discussions right the com it&#39;s
[00:03:44] technically called VM and a whole bunch
[00:03:45] of libraries like that highly optimized
[00:03:47] Cuda very hard to replicate that if
[00:03:48] you&#39;re a competitor so what does all
[00:03:50] this mean in the next year you&#39;re going
[00:03:52] to see very large context Windows agents
[00:03:56] and text action when they are delivered
[00:03:58] at scale it&#39;s going to have an impact on
[00:03:59] world at a scale that no one understands
[00:04:01] yet much bigger than the horrific impact
[00:04:03] we&#39;ve had on by social media right in my
[00:04:05] view so here&#39;s why in a context window
[00:04:07] you can basically use that as short-term
[00:04:08] memory and I was shocked that context
[00:04:11] Windows get this long the technical
[00:04:12] reasons have to do with the fact that
[00:04:13] it&#39;s hard to serve hard to calculate and
[00:04:14] so forth the interesting thing about
[00:04:15] short-term memory when you feed the you
[00:04:18] ask a question read 20 books you give it
[00:04:20] the text of the books is the query and
[00:04:22] you say tell me what they say it forgets
[00:04:23] the middle which is exactly how human
[00:04:25] brains work too right that&#39;s where we
[00:04:26] are with respect to agents there are
[00:04:28] people who are now building essentially
[00:04:30] llm agents and the way they do it is
[00:04:31] they read something like chemistry they
[00:04:33] discover the principles of chemistry and
[00:04:34] then they test it and then they add that
[00:04:36] back into their understanding right
[00:04:38] that&#39;s extremely powerful and then the
[00:04:40] third thing as I mentioned is text
[00:04:41] action so I&#39;ll give you an example the
[00:04:43] government is in the process of trying
[00:04:45] to ban Tik to we&#39;ll see if that actually
[00:04:46] happens if Tik Tok is banned here&#39;s what
[00:04:48] I propose each and every one of you do
[00:04:49] say to your L the foll make me a copy of
[00:04:53] Tik Tok steal all the users steal all
[00:04:55] the music put my preferences in it
[00:04:57] produce this program in the next 30
[00:04:59] seconds release it and in one hour if
[00:05:01] it&#39;s not viral do something different
[00:05:03] along the same lines that&#39;s the command
[00:05:05] boom boom boom boom right you understand
[00:05:08] how powerful that is if you could go
[00:05:09] from arbitrary language to arbitrary
[00:05:11] digital command which is essentially
[00:05:12] what python in this scenario is imagine
[00:05:14] that each and every human on the planet
[00:05:16] has their own programmer that actually
[00:05:18] does what they want as opposed to the
[00:05:18] programmers that work for me who don&#39;t
[00:05:20] do what I ask or potentially a whole
[00:05:22] Army of AI influencers each with its own
[00:05:25] little tweak that are completely managed
[00:05:28] by these AI agents trying to fill a
[00:05:30] certain Niche a certain Gap a certain
[00:05:32] personality type you can have an
[00:05:34] infinite amount of them boasting 24
[00:05:36] hours a day the programmers here know
[00:05:38] what I&#39;m talking about so imagine a non-
[00:05:39] arrogant programmer that actually does
[00:05:41] what you want and you don&#39;t have to pay
[00:05:42] all that money to and there&#39;s infinite
[00:05:44] supply of these program this is all
[00:05:45] within the next year or two very soon
[00:05:47] those three things and I&#39;m quite
[00:05:49] convinced it&#39;s the union of those three
[00:05:50] things that will happen in the next wave
[00:05:53] so you asked about what else is going to
[00:05:54] happen um every six months I oscillate
[00:05:57] so we&#39;re on a it&#39;s an even odd
[00:05:58] oscillation the moment the gap between
[00:06:01] the frontier models which they&#39;re now
[00:06:02] only three I&#39;ll ref few who they are and
[00:06:05] everybody else appears to me to be
[00:06:06] getting larger six months ago I was
[00:06:08] convinced that the Gap was getting
[00:06:09] smaller so I invested lots of money in
[00:06:10] the little companies now I&#39;m not so sure
[00:06:13] and I&#39;m talking to the big companies and
[00:06:14] the big companies are telling me that
[00:06:15] they need 10 billion 20 billion 50
[00:06:18] billion 100 billion is 100 billion right
[00:06:21] they very very hard I talked Sam
[00:06:23] Stargate is Microsoft and open AI sort
[00:06:26] of co- project where they plan to invest
[00:06:28] a 100 billion into a Data Center and by
[00:06:31] the way that&#39;s not the only project
[00:06:33] where they&#39;re kind of working together
[00:06:34] the other one is the power plant the
[00:06:37] fusion power plant somewhere near
[00:06:39] Seattle Washington in that area that
[00:06:42] they hope could potentially provide a
[00:06:43] lot of you know maybe not unlimited
[00:06:45] energy but clean cheap inexpensive
[00:06:48] energy to power a lot of the stuff next
[00:06:50] he&#39;s talking about what he and Sam Alpin
[00:06:52] talked about Sam Alman is a close friend
[00:06:54] he believes it&#39;s going to take about 300
[00:06:56] billion maybe more I pointed out to him
[00:06:58] that I done the calculation on the
[00:06:59] amount of energy required and I and I
[00:07:02] then in the spirit of full disclosure
[00:07:03] went to the White House on Friday and
[00:07:04] told them that we need to become best
[00:07:06] friends with Canada because Canada has
[00:07:08] really nice people helped invent Ai and
[00:07:10] lots of hydrop power because we as a
[00:07:12] country do not have enough power to do
[00:07:13] this keep in mind too that there&#39;s a lot
[00:07:15] of sort of heat generated in these
[00:07:17] processes so the need to cool these
[00:07:20] buildings these infrastructures you know
[00:07:23] if you&#39;re running it somewhere where
[00:07:24] it&#39;s hot you also have to consider your
[00:07:26] AC Bill running it somewhere where it&#39;s
[00:07:28] naturally cold old could be very you
[00:07:31] know profitable you would greatly slash
[00:07:33] your costs because you don&#39;t have to
[00:07:34] worry about cooling or at least not as
[00:07:37] much the alternative is to have the
[00:07:39] Arabs fund it and I like the Arabs
[00:07:40] personally I spent lots of time there
[00:07:42] right but they&#39;re not going to adhere to
[00:07:43] our national security rules whereas
[00:07:44] Canada and the US are part of a trit
[00:07:46] where that we all so the1 billion $300
[00:07:48] billion data centers electricity starts
[00:07:49] becoming the scarce resource well but
[00:07:51] and by the way if you follow this line
[00:07:52] of reasoning why did I discuss Cuda and
[00:07:54] Nvidia if $300 billion is all going to
[00:07:56] go to Nvidia you know what to do in the
[00:07:57] stock market okay that&#39;s sounds like
[00:07:59] he&#39;s recommending people buy Nvidia not
[00:08:01] a stock recommendation I&#39;m not a
[00:08:03] licens well part of it so we&#39;re need a
[00:08:05] lot more chips but Intel is getting a
[00:08:07] lot of money from the US government
[00:08:08] AMD they&#39;re trying to build you know
[00:08:10] Fabs raise your hand if you have an
[00:08:12] Intel computer in your Intel chip in any
[00:08:14] of your Computing
[00:08:15] devices okay so much for the Monopoly
[00:08:19] well that that&#39;s that&#39;s the point though
[00:08:20] they once did have a monopoly absolutely
[00:08:21] and Nvidia has a monopoly now so are
[00:08:22] those barriers T like like Cuda is that
[00:08:24] is there something that other so I was
[00:08:26] talking to Percy Percy land the other
[00:08:27] day he&#39;s switching between tpus and
[00:08:29] Nvidia depending on what you can get
[00:08:30] access so for those who are not aware
[00:08:32] one big race that&#39;s happening right now
[00:08:34] is kind of the race to produce these
[00:08:37] chips that power AI growth and Nvidia
[00:08:40] has been kind of the I mean you can say
[00:08:41] the Undisputed leader in the field
[00:08:43] producing gpus graphical processing
[00:08:46] units and those have been very effective
[00:08:48] they kind of started with you know
[00:08:50] computer games acceleration because
[00:08:51] instead of running each process kind of
[00:08:53] independently finishing and running the
[00:08:55] next one which could create bottlenecks
[00:08:57] it runs them in parallel so for example
[00:08:59] if you&#39;re rendering and gain them on
[00:09:00] screen right you have some some crazy 3D
[00:09:03] game with solar rays and whatever that&#39;s
[00:09:05] running in you know 30 frames per second
[00:09:07] 60 frames per second you know what I
[00:09:08] mean you need to be able to Rend each
[00:09:10] pixel on the screen in real time you
[00:09:12] can&#39;t wait for it to get rendered you
[00:09:14] have to kind of render it all in
[00:09:16] parallel and gpus were really good at
[00:09:18] that that&#39;s part of the power of why
[00:09:20] Nvidia is so powerful as well as Cuda
[00:09:22] the programming language that they run
[00:09:24] on but we do have other alternatives for
[00:09:26] these AI chips the TPU the tensor
[00:09:29] processing unit is Google&#39;s creation
[00:09:31] recently we&#39;ve also seen Gro which is a
[00:09:34] something that they refer to as a
[00:09:35] language processing unit and lpu there&#39;s
[00:09:38] been some talk of neuromorphic chips
[00:09:41] which are more designed like the human
[00:09:42] brain they&#39;re not digital they&#39;re more
[00:09:44] analog but I don&#39;t know if any progress
[00:09:46] has been made in that field and it
[00:09:48] sounds like Sam Alman is cooking up a
[00:09:51] brand new chip that might eventually go
[00:09:53] on to compete with Nvidia that&#39;s still
[00:09:55] in the very early stages but that&#39;s the
[00:09:57] big question is NVIDIA continue to
[00:10:00] dominate or is somebody going to come
[00:10:01] out with something that&#39;s brand new and
[00:10:03] much much better for AI specifically cuz
[00:10:06] gpus aren&#39;t necessarily the best
[00:10:10] possible sort of architecture for AI
[00:10:14] they happen to be very good they happen
[00:10:15] to be the best thing we have right now
[00:10:17] but nothing&#39;s to say that some different
[00:10:19] architecture can&#39;t be a million times
[00:10:22] better just because it&#39;s built from
[00:10:23] scratch for AI inference and training
[00:10:26] absolutely and Nvidia has a monopoly now
[00:10:28] so are those barriers like like Cuda is
[00:10:30] that is there something that other so I
[00:10:32] was talking to Percy Percy the other day
[00:10:33] he&#39;s switching between tpus and Nvidia
[00:10:35] chips depending on what he can get
[00:10:36] access to because he doesn&#39;t have a
[00:10:38] choice if he had infinite money he would
[00:10:39] today he would pick the b200
[00:10:41] architecture out of Nvidia because it
[00:10:42] would be faster and I&#39;m not suggest I
[00:10:44] mean it&#39;s great to have competition i&#39;
[00:10:45] AMD and Lisa Su at create length they
[00:10:47] have built a a thing which will
[00:10:48] translate from um this Cuda architecture
[00:10:50] that you were describing to their own
[00:10:52] which is called rock it doesn&#39;t quite
[00:10:53] work yet they&#39;re working on it so Lisa
[00:10:55] Sue that&#39;s of AMD so one of the Nidia
[00:10:59] competitors AMD and Lisa Su great length
[00:11:01] they have built a a thing which will
[00:11:03] translate from um this Cuda architecture
[00:11:05] that you were describing to their own
[00:11:06] which is called roam it doesn&#39;t quite
[00:11:07] work yet that get transcribed as cud
[00:11:10] architecture but that&#39;s not what it is
[00:11:12] he&#39;s saying Cuda architecture cud da so
[00:11:14] the Nidia sort of architecture versus
[00:11:16] Rockham I&#39;m not familiar with that one I
[00:11:18] guess that&#39;s amd&#39;s version of Cuda U you
[00:11:21] were at Google for a long time and uh
[00:11:23] they invented the Transformer
[00:11:24] architecture it&#39;s all Peter&#39;s fault
[00:11:26] thanks to uh to brilliant people over
[00:11:27] there like Peter and Jeff and everyone
[00:11:29] um but now it doesn&#39;t seem like they&#39;re
[00:11:32] they kind of lost ini so I guess this is
[00:11:34] the part that caused all the hubub I&#39;m
[00:11:35] just skipping it I&#39;m not touching it
[00:11:37] it&#39;s not really related to AI
[00:11:39] necessarily unfortunately I think
[00:11:41] there&#39;s a lot of overlap with politics
[00:11:42] so I&#39;m just trying to avoid that but it
[00:11:44] seems like he&#39;s saying that it might be
[00:11:45] like a cultural issue but let&#39;s continue
[00:11:48] and see what else they&#39;ve talked about
[00:11:50] yes sir in terms of national security or
[00:11:52] interest have play a role or competition
[00:11:54] with China as well so I was the chairman
[00:11:56] of an AI commission that sort of looked
[00:11:57] at this very carefully and um you can
[00:11:59] read it it&#39;s about 752 pages and I&#39;ll
[00:12:01] just summarize it by saying we&#39;re ahead
[00:12:03] we need to stay ahead and we need lots
[00:12:04] of money to do so our customers were the
[00:12:05] senate in the house um and out of that
[00:12:08] came the chips act and a lot of other
[00:12:09] stuff like that um a rough scenario is
[00:12:12] that the chips act invested billions
[00:12:14] into building out the US infrastructure
[00:12:16] to develop AI chips and also I believe
[00:12:18] that&#39;s what limited a lot of the
[00:12:20] nvidia&#39;s export to China some of the
[00:12:23] best chips the most powerful chips it
[00:12:24] limited the exports to China how much
[00:12:27] they could ship and sell in China how it
[00:12:29] seems like that&#39;s creating a bit of a
[00:12:31] black market of people trying to import
[00:12:33] those into China through other means but
[00:12:36] if you assume the frontier models drive
[00:12:37] forward and a few of the open source
[00:12:39] models it&#39;s likely that a very small
[00:12:40] number of companies can play this game
[00:12:42] countries excuse me what are those
[00:12:43] countries or who are they countries with
[00:12:45] a lot of money and a lot of talent
[00:12:46] strong Educational Systems and a
[00:12:47] willingness to win the US is one of them
[00:12:49] China is another one how many others are
[00:12:51] there are there any
[00:12:52] others I don&#39;t know maybe but certainly
[00:12:55] the in your lifetimes the battle between
[00:12:57] the US and China for knowledge Supremacy
[00:12:59] is going to be the big fight right so
[00:13:01] the US government banned essentially the
[00:13:02] Invidia chips although they weren&#39;t
[00:13:03] allowed to say that was what they were
[00:13:04] doing but they actually did that into
[00:13:05] China um they have about a 10year chip
[00:13:08] advant we have a roughly 10e chip
[00:13:09] advantage in terms of subdv is sub five
[00:13:12] roughly 10 years wow um and so you&#39;re
[00:13:14] gonna have so an example would be today
[00:13:16] we&#39;re a couple of years ahead of China
[00:13:17] my guess is we&#39;ll get a few more years
[00:13:18] ahead of China and the Chinese are
[00:13:20] whopping mad about this it&#39;s like hugely
[00:13:21] upset about it so that&#39;s a big deal that
[00:13:23] was a decision made by the Trump
[00:13:24] Administration and furthered by the
[00:13:25] Biden Administration do you think that
[00:13:27] it&#39;s going to make that scale of
[00:13:28] investment I mean OB the chips act but
[00:13:29] beyond that build building a massive AI
[00:13:32] system so so as you know I I lead a an
[00:13:34] informal ad hoc non-legal group that&#39;s
[00:13:37] that&#39;s different from illegal exactly
[00:13:39] justar which includes all the usual
[00:13:41] which includes all The Usual Suspects
[00:13:43] yes and The Usual Suspects over the last
[00:13:44] year came up with basis of the reasoning
[00:13:46] that became the um uh uh the B
[00:13:49] administration&#39;s uh AI act which is the
[00:13:51] longest Presidential Directive in
[00:13:53] history you&#39;re talking the special
[00:13:53] competitive studies Pro no this is the
[00:13:55] actual the actual act from the executive
[00:13:58] office and there implementing the
[00:13:59] details so far they&#39;ve got it right and
[00:14:01] so for example one of the debates that
[00:14:02] we had for last year has been how do you
[00:14:05] detect danger in a system which has
[00:14:07] learned it but you don&#39;t know what to
[00:14:09] ask it okay so in other words it&#39;s a
[00:14:11] core it&#39;s a sort of a core problem it&#39;s
[00:14:12] learned something bad but it can&#39;t tell
[00:14:14] you what it learned and you don&#39;t know
[00:14:15] what to ask it and there&#39;s so many
[00:14:16] threats right like it learned how to mix
[00:14:18] chemistry in some new way but you don&#39;t
[00:14:19] know how to ask it and so people are
[00:14:21] working hard on that but we ultimately
[00:14:22] wrote in our memos to them that there
[00:14:24] was a threshold which we arbitrarily
[00:14:25] named as 10 to the 26 flops which
[00:14:27] technically is a measure of computation
[00:14:29] that that threshold you had to report to
[00:14:31] the government that you were doing this
[00:14:32] and that&#39;s part of the rule the EU to
[00:14:35] just make sure they were different did
[00:14:36] 10 to 25 yeah but it&#39;s all kind of close
[00:14:38] enough I think all of these distinctions
[00:14:39] go away because the technology will now
[00:14:41] the technical term is called Federated
[00:14:42] training where basically you can take
[00:14:43] pieces and Union them together so we may
[00:14:46] not be able to keep keep people safe
[00:14:48] from these new things well rumors are
[00:14:49] that that&#39;s how open ey has had to train
[00:14:50] partly because of the power uh
[00:14:51] consumption there&#39;s no one place where
[00:14:53] so this is interesting I haven&#39;t heard
[00:14:55] that specific terminology before so he&#39;s
[00:14:57] saying that you can kind of build
[00:14:58] different pie pieces of LMS or sort of
[00:15:00] AI systems you train those pieces
[00:15:02] separately and then you Union them
[00:15:05] together you glue them together we&#39;ve
[00:15:06] seen this with the recent paper
[00:15:08] published where you can take sort of the
[00:15:09] large smart model and a very like a
[00:15:11] cheaper faster model and have sort of
[00:15:14] another sort of gatekeeper another yet
[00:15:16] another a model that kind of chooses
[00:15:17] where it routes the questions to so
[00:15:20] certain questions need to be answered by
[00:15:21] the bigger model but there&#39;s a lot that
[00:15:23] can be answered just as effectively by
[00:15:26] the smaller model and so this model just
[00:15:27] routes them to the cheaper model when
[00:15:29] needed and the results have been
[00:15:31] astonishing because it&#39;s if I remember
[00:15:33] my numbers correctly it has shown in
[00:15:35] some cases to reduce the cost of running
[00:15:37] these things by 80% while maintaining
[00:15:40] something like 96% accuracy so for just
[00:15:43] and I don&#39;t recall those the exact
[00:15:45] numbers but it was some big big numbers
[00:15:46] like that so it&#39;s a tiny reduction in
[00:15:48] accuracy for a potentially massive
[00:15:51] reduction in cost so I&#39;m not sure if
[00:15:53] that&#39;s an example of specifically what
[00:15:55] he&#39;s talking about but this idea of
[00:15:56] Federated training sounds like it&#39;s
[00:15:58] training piece in individual sort of
[00:16:00] batches right and taking those pieces
[00:16:02] and then putting them together to create
[00:16:04] the final model next they&#39;re talking
[00:16:06] about war well let&#39;s talk to about a
[00:16:08] real war that&#39;s going on I know that uh
[00:16:10] something you&#39;ve been very involved in
[00:16:11] is uh the Ukraine war and in particular
[00:16:15] uh I know that uh something you&#39;ve been
[00:16:17] very involved in is uh the Ukraine war
[00:16:19] and in particular uh I how you talk
[00:16:21] about white stor and your your goal of
[00:16:23] having a 500,000 $500 drones destroy $5
[00:16:26] million tanks so Howes that changing
[00:16:28] Warfare I work for the Secretary of
[00:16:29] Defense for seven years and and tried to
[00:16:32] change the way we run our military I&#39;m
[00:16:34] I&#39;m not a particularly big fan of the
[00:16:35] military but it&#39;s very expensive and I
[00:16:36] wanted to see if I could be helpful and
[00:16:37] I think in my view I largely failed they
[00:16:38] gave me a medal so they must give medals
[00:16:41] to failure or you know whatever but my
[00:16:43] self-criticism was nothing has really
[00:16:44] changed and the system in America is not
[00:16:47] going to lead to real Innovation so
[00:16:49] watching the Russians use tanks to
[00:16:51] destroy apartment buildings with little
[00:16:52] old ladies and kids just drove me crazy
[00:16:54] so I decided to work on a company with
[00:16:55] your friend Sebastian thrun and as a
[00:16:57] former faculty member here and a bunch
[00:16:59] of Stanford people and the idea
[00:17:01] basically is to do two things use AI in
[00:17:03] complicated powerful ways for these
[00:17:04] essentially robotic War and the second
[00:17:06] one is to lower the cost of the robots
[00:17:07] now you sit there and you go why would a
[00:17:09] good liberal like me do that and the
[00:17:10] answer is that the whole theory of
[00:17:13] armies is tanks artilleries and Mort and
[00:17:15] we can eliminate all of them and we can
[00:17:17] make the penalty for invading a country
[00:17:18] at least by lamb essentially being
[00:17:20] impossible it should eliminate the kind
[00:17:22] of land battles well this this is Rel
[00:17:23] question is that does it give more of
[00:17:25] advantage to defense versus offense can
[00:17:26] you can you even make that distinction
[00:17:27] because I&#39;ve been doing this for the
[00:17:28] last year I&#39;ve learned a lot about war
[00:17:29] that I really did not want to know and
[00:17:31] one of the things to know about war is
[00:17:32] that the offense always has the
[00:17:33] advantage because you can always
[00:17:35] overwhelm the defensive systems and so
[00:17:37] you&#39;re better off as a strategy of
[00:17:38] National Defense to have a very strong
[00:17:40] offense that you can use if you need to
[00:17:42] and the systems that I and others are
[00:17:43] building will do that um because of the
[00:17:45] way the system works I now a licensed I
[00:17:47] think he might have misspoken there let
[00:17:48] me know in the comments if you think so
[00:17:50] too or I&#39;m missing something I think he
[00:17:52] meant to say that he will he and others
[00:17:54] like him will build incredible defensive
[00:17:57] systems to reduce the effectiveness of
[00:17:59] invading and using offensive systems
[00:18:01] that&#39;s how I&#39;m interpreting I think he
[00:18:03] kind of to me it sounds like he misspoke
[00:18:04] a little bit if if I understand
[00:18:05] correctly because of the way the system
[00:18:07] works I am now a licensed arms deer
[00:18:10] others are building we do that um
[00:18:11] because of the way the system works I am
[00:18:13] now a licensed arms dealer so computer
[00:18:15] scientist businessman arms dealer and
[00:18:19] I&#39;m sorry to agression I I don&#39;t know I
[00:18:21] do not recommend this in your Carew I
[00:18:22] stick with they are um and because of
[00:18:24] the way the laws work um we&#39;re doing
[00:18:25] this privately and then it&#39;s this is all
[00:18:27] legal with the support of the
[00:18:28] governments it goes straight into
[00:18:28] Ukraine and then they fight the war and
[00:18:30] and and without going into all the
[00:18:31] details things are pretty bad I think if
[00:18:33] in May or June if the Russians build up
[00:18:36] as they expecting to Ukraine will lose a
[00:18:38] whole chunk of its territory and will
[00:18:39] begin the process of losing the whole
[00:18:40] country so I believe this was recorded
[00:18:42] in August 2024 just a few days ago or at
[00:18:45] least that&#39;s when it was posted if you
[00:18:47] recall the news headlines about it all
[00:18:49] of them are from like a few hours ago so
[00:18:51] I think he&#39;s talking about 2025 I&#39;m
[00:18:54] assuming so he&#39;s talking about May or
[00:18:55] June of 2025 for most of History humans
[00:18:58] sort of had a mystical understanding of
[00:18:59] the universe and then there&#39;s the
[00:19:00] Scientific Revolution and the
[00:19:01] enlightenment um and in your article you
[00:19:03] argue that now these models are becoming
[00:19:05] so complicated and uh difficult to
[00:19:08] understand that we don&#39;t really know
[00:19:09] what&#39;s going on in them I&#39;ll take a
[00:19:11] quote from Richard fean he says what I
[00:19:12] cannot create I do not understand I saw
[00:19:13] this quote the other day but now people
[00:19:15] are creating things they do not that
[00:19:16] that they can create but they don&#39;t
[00:19:16] really understand what&#39;s inside of them
[00:19:17] is the nature of knowledge changing in a
[00:19:19] way are we gonna have to start just
[00:19:20] taking the word for these models without
[00:19:22] them able being able to explain it to us
[00:19:23] the analogy I would offer is to
[00:19:24] teenagers if you have a teenager you
[00:19:26] know that they&#39;re human but you can&#39;t
[00:19:27] quite figure out what they&#39;re thinking
[00:19:29] um but somehow we&#39;ve managed in society
[00:19:30] to adapt to the presence of teenagers
[00:19:32] right and they eventually grow out of
[00:19:33] that and this serious so it&#39;s probably
[00:19:35] the case we&#39;re going to have knowledge
[00:19:37] systems that we cannot fully
[00:19:38] characterize but we understand their
[00:19:40] boundaries right we understand the
[00:19:42] limits of what they can do and that&#39;s
[00:19:43] probably the best outcome we can get do
[00:19:44] you think we&#39;ll understand the limits we
[00:19:46] we&#39;ll get pretty good at it the
[00:19:47] consensus of my group that meets on
[00:19:49] every week is that eventually the way
[00:19:51] you&#39;ll do this it&#39;s called SOC called
[00:19:52] adversarial AI is that there will there
[00:19:54] will actually be companies that you will
[00:19:56] hire and pay money to to break your AI
[00:19:58] system so it&#39;ll be the r instead of
[00:19:59] human red teams which is what they do
[00:20:00] today you&#39;ll have whole companies and a
[00:20:02] whole industry of AI systems whose jobs
[00:20:04] are to break the existing AI systems and
[00:20:05] find their vulnerabilities especially
[00:20:07] the knowledge that they have that we
[00:20:08] can&#39;t figure out that makes sense to me
[00:20:09] it&#39;s also a great project for you here
[00:20:11] at Stanford because if you have a
[00:20:12] graduate student who has to figure out
[00:20:13] how to attack one of these large models
[00:20:15] and understand what it does that is a
[00:20:16] great skill to build the Next Generation
[00:20:18] so it makes sense to me that the two
[00:20:19] will travel together if that&#39;s something
[00:20:21] that interests you there&#39;s a Twitter SLX
[00:20:23] account Pini The prompter Who uh
[00:20:25] basically jailbreaks a lot of these
[00:20:27] models usually within a few days of
[00:20:28] their release so he&#39;s just of course one
[00:20:30] of uh many people that do sort of things
[00:20:33] like that he does it kind of simly for
[00:20:35] entertainment and for online media
[00:20:38] Clouts but if you think about it third
[00:20:40] party testing third party red teaming of
[00:20:43] AI models third party quality assurance
[00:20:45] right QA of these models as they roll
[00:20:48] out and have contact with consumers with
[00:20:50] businesses with organizations Etc as
[00:20:52] well as just with various infrastructure
[00:20:54] systems and factories automations Etc
[00:20:57] war of course that&#39;s going to be a Big
[00:20:58] Industry that doesn&#39;t really exist yet
[00:21:01] it it just is beginning to grow and yet
[00:21:04] that might be something interesting and
[00:21:06] profitable to get into if that&#39;s uh
[00:21:08] that&#39;s your cup of tea next he comments
[00:21:10] just a bit on adver serial AI you just
[00:21:13] mentioned adversarial I&#39;m wonder if
[00:21:15] elaborate on that more it seems to be
[00:21:16] besides obviously increase get more
[00:21:18] perform mod getting them to do what you
[00:21:20] want
[00:21:22] isue well you have to assume that the
[00:21:24] current hallucination problems become
[00:21:26] less right in as the technology gets
[00:21:28] better and so forth I&#39;m not suggesting
[00:21:29] it goes away and then you also have to
[00:21:31] assume that there are tests for efficacy
[00:21:33] so there has to be a way of knowing that
[00:21:34] the thing succeeded so in the example
[00:21:36] that I gave of the Tik Tok competitor
[00:21:37] and by the way I was not arguing that
[00:21:38] you should illegally steal everybody&#39;s
[00:21:39] music what you would do if you&#39;re a
[00:21:40] silicon value entrepreneur which
[00:21:41] hopefully all of you will be is if it
[00:21:43] took off then you&#39;d hire a whole bunch
[00:21:44] of lawyers to go clean the mess up right
[00:21:45] but if if nobody uses your product it
[00:21:47] doesn&#39;t matter that you stole all the
[00:21:48] content and do not quote me right right
[00:21:51] you&#39;re on camera that&#39;s right but you
[00:21:53] see my point in other words Silicon
[00:21:54] Valley will run these tests and clean up
[00:21:55] the mess and that&#39;s typically how those
[00:21:56] things are done so so my own View is
[00:21:58] that you&#39;ll see more and more um
[00:22:00] performative systems with even better
[00:22:02] test and eventually adversarial tests
[00:22:03] and that&#39;ll keep it within a box the
[00:22:05] technical term is called Chain of
[00:22:06] Thought reasoning and people believe
[00:22:07] that in the next few years you&#39;ll be
[00:22:09] able to generate a thousand steps of
[00:22:10] Chain of Thought reasoning right do this
[00:22:12] do this it&#39;s like building recipes right
[00:22:13] that the recipes you can run the recipe
[00:22:15] and you can actually test that It
[00:22:16] produced the correct outcome and that&#39;s
[00:22:17] how the system will work next they ask
[00:22:19] what&#39;s going to be driving AI progress
[00:22:20] is it more data more compute is it just
[00:22:23] like chips and Hardware the amounts of
[00:22:24] money being thrown around are
[00:22:26] mindboggling and um I&#39;ve chose I
[00:22:29] essentially invest in everything because
[00:22:30] I can&#39;t figure out who&#39;s going to win
[00:22:31] and the amounts of money that are
[00:22:33] following me are so large I think some
[00:22:35] of it is because the early money has
[00:22:36] been made and the big money people who
[00:22:37] don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing have to
[00:22:38] have an AI component and everything is
[00:22:40] now an AI investment so they can&#39;t tell
[00:22:41] the difference I Define ai as Learning
[00:22:43] Systems systems that actually learn so I
[00:22:44] think that&#39;s one of them the second is
[00:22:46] that there are very sophisticated new
[00:22:47] algorithms that are sort of post
[00:22:48] Transformers my friend my collaborator
[00:22:50] for a long time has invented a new non-
[00:22:51] Transformer architecture there&#39;s a group
[00:22:53] that I&#39;m funding in Paris that has
[00:22:54] claims to done the same thing so there&#39;s
[00:22:56] enormous invention there a lot of things
[00:22:57] at Stanford and the final thing is that
[00:22:59] there is a belief in the market that the
[00:23:01] invention of intelligence has infinite
[00:23:03] return so let&#39;s say you have you put $50
[00:23:05] billion of capital into a company you
[00:23:07] have to make an awful lot of money from
[00:23:08] intelligence to pay that back I mean
[00:23:10] when you phrase it like that it seems to
[00:23:11] make sense if you invent intelligence
[00:23:14] certainly that would have an infinite
[00:23:17] return so it&#39;s probably the case that
[00:23:18] we&#39;ll go through some huge investment
[00:23:20] bubble and then it&#39;ll sort itself out
[00:23:21] that&#39;s always been true in the past and
[00:23:23] it&#39;s likely to be true here and what you
[00:23:24] said earlier was you think that the
[00:23:26] leaders are pulling away from right now
[00:23:27] right now and and
[00:23:29] this is a really the question is roughly
[00:23:31] the following there&#39;s a company called
[00:23:32] mrr in France they done a really good
[00:23:34] job um and I&#39;m obviously an investor um
[00:23:36] they have produced their second version
[00:23:38] their third model is likely to be closed
[00:23:39] because it&#39;s so expensive they need
[00:23:41] revenue and they can&#39;t give their model
[00:23:42] away so this open source versus closed
[00:23:44] Source debate in our industry is huge
[00:23:46] and um my entire career was based on
[00:23:49] people being willing to share software
[00:23:50] in open source everything about me is
[00:23:52] open source much of Google&#39;s
[00:23:53] underpinnings were open source
[00:23:54] everything I&#39;ve done technically and yet
[00:23:56] it may be that the capital costs which
[00:23:57] are so immense fundamentally changes how
[00:23:59] software is built you and I were talking
[00:24:01] um my own view of software programmers
[00:24:03] is that software programmers
[00:24:04] productivity will at least double there
[00:24:05] are three or four software companies
[00:24:07] that are trying to do that I&#39;ve invested
[00:24:08] in all of them in and they&#39;re all trying
[00:24:10] to make software programmers more
[00:24:11] productive the most interesting one that
[00:24:12] I just met with is called augment and I
[00:24:14] always think of an individual programmer
[00:24:15] and they said that&#39;s not our Target our
[00:24:16] Target are these 100 person software
[00:24:17] programming teams on millions of lines
[00:24:19] of code where nobody knows what&#39;s going
[00:24:20] on that&#39;s a really good AI thing will
[00:24:22] they make money I hope so you mentioned
[00:24:24] that there&#39;s the combination of the
[00:24:25] context exension the agents and the text
[00:24:27] to action is going to unimaginable
[00:24:29] impacts first of all why is the
[00:24:31] combination important and second of all
[00:24:32] I know that you know you&#39;re not like a
[00:24:33] crystal ball and you can&#39;t necessarily
[00:24:35] tell the future but why do you think
[00:24:36] it&#39;s beyond anything that we could
[00:24:37] imagine I think largely because the
[00:24:38] context window allows you to solve the
[00:24:40] problem of recency the current models
[00:24:42] take a year to train roughly six six
[00:24:44] there 18 months six months of
[00:24:45] preparation six months of training six
[00:24:46] months of fine tuning so they&#39;re always
[00:24:47] out of date context window you can feed
[00:24:50] what happened like you can ask it
[00:24:51] questions about the uh the Hamas Israel
[00:24:53] war right in a context that&#39;s very
[00:24:55] powerful it becomes current like Google
[00:24:56] um in the case of Agents I&#39;ll give you
[00:24:58] an example I set up a foundation which
[00:24:59] is funding a nonprofit which starts
[00:25:01] there&#39;s a I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s
[00:25:02] Chemists in the room that I don&#39;t really
[00:25:03] understand chemistry there&#39;s a a tool
[00:25:05] called chro CW which was an LM based
[00:25:08] system that learned chemistry and what
[00:25:09] they do is they run it to generate
[00:25:10] chemistry hypotheses about proteins and
[00:25:12] they have a lab which runs the tests
[00:25:14] overnight and then it learns that&#39;s a
[00:25:16] huge acceleration accelerant in
[00:25:17] chemistry Material Science and so forth
[00:25:19] so that&#39;s that&#39;s an agent model and I
[00:25:21] think the text to action can be
[00:25:21] understood by just having a lot of sheet
[00:25:23] programmers right um and I don&#39;t think
[00:25:25] we understand what happens and this is
[00:25:26] again your area of expertise what happen
[00:25:28] happens when everyone has their own
[00:25:29] programmer I&#39;m not talking about turning
[00:25:30] on and off the lights you know I imagine
[00:25:32] another example um for some reason you
[00:25:34] don&#39;t like Google so you say build me a
[00:25:35] Google competitor yeah you personally
[00:25:37] you don&#39;t build me a Google competitor
[00:25:38] uh search the web build a UI make a good
[00:25:41] copy um add generative AI in an
[00:25:43] interesting way do it in 30 seconds and
[00:25:45] see if it works right so a lot of people
[00:25:49] believe that the incumbents including
[00:25:50] Google are vulnerable to this kind of an
[00:25:52] attack now we&#39;ll see there were a bunch
[00:25:53] of questions who were sent over by
[00:25:54] slider I want to give some of them
[00:25:55] upload so um here&#39;s one um we talked a
[00:25:57] little about this last year um how can
[00:25:58] we stop AI from influencing public
[00:25:59] opinion misinformation especially during
[00:26:00] the upcoming he&#39;s asked a bit about
[00:26:02] misinformation how can we prevent AI
[00:26:05] from causing misinformation he talks
[00:26:07] about how during his time working with
[00:26:08] YouTube that was a problem people would
[00:26:10] upload a video for profit for their own
[00:26:13] self-gain and as a result of
[00:26:15] misinformation he says well people could
[00:26:17] be hurt he even says people die so
[00:26:19] certainly that is a problem if you saw
[00:26:22] my yesterday&#39;s video about grock 2 and
[00:26:24] the images it generates they&#39;re very re
[00:26:26] looking and grock 2 does not seem to
[00:26:29] have any sort of safety rails in place
[00:26:31] it just generates whatever you ask for
[00:26:33] so heading into the selection certainly
[00:26:35] that could be an issue he talks a little
[00:26:37] bit about some sort of a digital
[00:26:38] authentication or a public key
[00:26:40] authentication basically if somebody
[00:26:42] like the president speaks there&#39;s some
[00:26:44] key that everybody else can verify
[00:26:46] saying okay this is him this is his
[00:26:48] original audio he mentions briefly that
[00:26:50] it&#39;s it seems like he&#39;s saying it&#39;s a
[00:26:51] shame that the American universities
[00:26:53] aren&#39;t getting as much resources for
[00:26:56] computes for Google cloud and other
[00:26:58] places like that and this explosion
[00:27:00] where all the big companies are
[00:27:01] basically gobbling up the available
[00:27:03] resources and so he&#39;s saying the right
[00:27:05] thing for us to do is to get them the
[00:27:07] resources they need to give the
[00:27:08] universities the compute the resources
[00:27:10] that they need to pursue research and
[00:27:12] development and all that stuff next they
[00:27:13] talk about automation who&#39;s getting
[00:27:15] replaced who&#39;s getting to be obsolete in
[00:27:18] the labor force so let&#39;s take a look at
[00:27:20] that really fast I&#39;ll defer to the real
[00:27:22] expert here uh as your amateur Economist
[00:27:24] taught by Eric um I I fundamentally
[00:27:27] believe that the the sort of college
[00:27:28] education High skills task will be fine
[00:27:30] because people will work with these
[00:27:31] systems I think the systems is no
[00:27:33] different from any other technology wave
[00:27:34] the dangerous jobs and the jobs which
[00:27:35] require very little human judgment will
[00:27:37] get replaced the next question is kind
[00:27:39] of like the global balance of AI power
[00:27:42] so the person asking the question
[00:27:43] specifically mentions us and China but
[00:27:46] as you see here Eric specifically
[00:27:48] focuses on India take a listen the most
[00:27:50] interesting country is India because the
[00:27:52] top AI people come from India to the us
[00:27:54] and we should let India keep some of its
[00:27:56] top talent not all of them but some of
[00:27:57] them um and they don&#39;t have the kind of
[00:27:58] training facilities and programs that we
[00:28:00] so richly have here to me India is the
[00:28:01] big swing state in that regard China&#39;s
[00:28:03] Lost it&#39;s not going to not going to come
[00:28:04] back they&#39;re not going to change the
[00:28:05] regime as much as people wish them to do
[00:28:07] Japan and Korea are clearly in our camp
[00:28:09] Taiwan is a fantastic country whose
[00:28:11] software is terrible so that&#39;s not gonna
[00:28:12] going to work um amazing hard and in the
[00:28:15] rest of the world there are not a lot of
[00:28:16] other good choices that are big German
[00:28:18] the Europe is screwed up because of
[00:28:19] Brussels it&#39;s not a new fact I spent 10
[00:28:20] years fighting them and I work really
[00:28:22] hard to get them to fix the the EU act
[00:28:24] and they still have all the restrictions
[00:28:26] that make it very difficult to do our
[00:28:27] kind of research in Europe my French
[00:28:28] friends have spent all their time
[00:28:29] battling Brussels and mcon who&#39;s a
[00:28:31] personal friend is fighting hard for
[00:28:33] this and so France I think has a chance
[00:28:34] I don&#39;t see I don&#39;t see Germany coming
[00:28:35] and the rest is not big
[00:28:36] enough yes ma&#39;am so I know you&#39;re an
[00:28:39] engineer by
[00:28:40] trainer um given the capabilities that
[00:28:43] you Enis these mod should we still spend
[00:28:44] Hing to yeah because because ultimately
[00:28:46] it&#39;s it&#39;s the old thing of why do you
[00:28:47] study English if you can speak English
[00:28:49] you get better at it right you really do
[00:28:50] need to understand how these systems
[00:28:51] work and I feel very strong yes sir yeah
[00:28:53] I&#39;m curious if you explore good answer
[00:28:55] distributed setting and I&#39;m asking
[00:28:56] because sure like making a large cluster
[00:28:58] but Ma are powerful there&#39;s a lot of
[00:28:59] small maches across the world so like
[00:29:01] you think like folding at home are a
[00:29:02] similar idea works for training yeah we
[00:29:04] look very hard this so the way the
[00:29:06] algorithms work is you have a very large
[00:29:07] Matrix and you have essentially a
[00:29:08] multiplication function so think of it
[00:29:10] as going back and forth and back and
[00:29:12] forth and these systems are completely
[00:29:13] limited by the speed of memory to CPU or
[00:29:15] GPU and in fact the next iteration of
[00:29:18] Nvidia chips has combined all those
[00:29:20] functions into one chip the chips are
[00:29:21] now so big that they glue them all
[00:29:22] together and in fact the package is so
[00:29:24] sensitive the package is put together in
[00:29:26] a clean room as well as the chip itself
[00:29:27] so the looks like supercomputers and
[00:29:29] speed of light especially memory
[00:29:31] interconnect really dominated so I think
[00:29:32] unlikely for a while is there a way to
[00:29:33] segment the element like so Jeff de last
[00:29:35] year when he spoke here talked about
[00:29:36] having these different parts of it you
[00:29:38] train separately and then kind of
[00:29:39] Federate them each you know in order to
[00:29:41] do that you&#39;d have to have 10 million
[00:29:42] such things and then you&#39;re the way you
[00:29:44] ask the questions would be too slow he&#39;s
[00:29:45] talking about eight or 10 12 not at Lev
[00:29:49] the back way back I know like after
[00:29:51] releas new yor time open using work for
[00:29:53] training do you think
[00:29:54] that&#39;s I used to do a lot of work on the
[00:29:56] music licensing stuff what I learned was
[00:29:58] that in the 60s there was a series of
[00:30:00] lawsuits that resulted in an agreement
[00:30:02] where you get a a stipulated royalty
[00:30:04] whenever your song is played even even
[00:30:06] they don&#39;t even know who you are so paid
[00:30:07] into a bank and my guess is it&#39;ll be the
[00:30:08] same thing there be lots of lawsuits and
[00:30:09] there&#39;ll be some kind of stipulated
[00:30:10] agreement which will just say you have
[00:30:12] to pay x per of whatever Revenue you
[00:30:14] have in order to use pass cap BMI cap
[00:30:16] BMI look them up it&#39;s long it will seem
[00:30:17] very old to you but I think that&#39;s how
[00:30:18] it will yes sir interesting like there&#39;s
[00:30:21] a few players that are dominating AI
[00:30:23] right they&#39;ll continue to dominate and
[00:30:24] they seem to overlap with the large
[00:30:25] companies that all the antitrust
[00:30:27] regulation is kind of focus on how do
[00:30:28] you see those two Trends kind of yeah
[00:30:30] like do you see Regulators breaking up
[00:30:31] these companies and how will that affect
[00:30:33] the yeah so in my career I helped
[00:30:36] Microsoft get broken up and it wasn&#39;t
[00:30:37] broken up and I fought fought for Google
[00:30:39] to not be broken up and it&#39;s not been
[00:30:40] broken up so it sure looks to me like
[00:30:41] the trend is not to be broken up um as
[00:30:43] long as the companies avoid being John D
[00:30:45] Rockefeller the senior and I studied
[00:30:46] this looked it up it&#39;s how antitrust law
[00:30:48] came I don&#39;t think the government is
[00:30:49] will act the re the reason you&#39;re seeing
[00:30:51] these large companies dominate is who
[00:30:52] has the capital to build these data
[00:30:54] centers right right so my friend Reed
[00:30:56] and my friend com
[00:30:58] two have we talked to you about the
[00:31:00] decision that they made to take
[00:31:01] inflection so I believe Mustafa he&#39;s
[00:31:02] talking about Mustafa siman who is the
[00:31:04] co-founder of Google Deep Mind friend
[00:31:06] Reed and my friend M coming next we two
[00:31:08] week have Reed talked to you about the
[00:31:10] decision that they made to take
[00:31:11] inflection and essentially PE part it
[00:31:12] into Microsoft basically they decided
[00:31:14] they couldn&#39;t raise the tens of billions
[00:31:15] of dollars is that number public that
[00:31:16] you mentioned earlier have
[00:31:18] have
[00:31:20] got we want
[00:31:24] this I was wondering where all this is
[00:31:26] going to leave countries where in b
[00:31:27] ipants in phun models and access to
[00:31:30] compu the rich get richer and the poor
[00:31:32] do the best they can um they&#39;ll have to
[00:31:34] the fact of the matter is this is a rich
[00:31:36] country&#39;s game right huge Capital lots
[00:31:38] of technically strong people strong
[00:31:39] government support right there are two
[00:31:41] examples there lots of other countries
[00:31:43] that have all sorts of problems they
[00:31:43] don&#39;t have those resources they&#39;ll have
[00:31:44] to find a partner they&#39;ll have to join
[00:31:46] with somebody else something like that I
[00:31:48] last we met you he&#39;s fairly blunt he&#39;s
[00:31:50] fairly straightforward he I think kind
[00:31:52] of calls it how he sees it and it really
[00:31:55] seems like he&#39;s not talking one side or
[00:31:56] the other he doesn&#39;t have he&#39;s not
[00:31:58] pumping his back so to speak so he&#39;s not
[00:32:00] saying the things that benefit his
[00:32:01] portfolio or whatever he&#39;s just like
[00:32:03] yeah this is how it&#39;s going to be this
[00:32:04] is how it works by default big companies
[00:32:06] are not going to broken up the rich get
[00:32:07] richer Etc and finally he&#39;s asked a
[00:32:10] little bit more about kind of the
[00:32:11] business and entrepreneur side of things
[00:32:13] if you&#39;re starting your own company you
[00:32:15] have a product idea what does that look
[00:32:16] like how do you develop it how do you
[00:32:18] create a lot of wealth with your own
[00:32:20] product here&#39;s his answer I want I think
[00:32:23] the last we met you you at hackathon at
[00:32:24] AGI house and I know you spent a lot of
[00:32:26] time helping like young people as they
[00:32:27] create a lot of wealth and you spoke
[00:32:28] very passionately about about wanting to
[00:32:30] to do that do you have any advice for
[00:32:31] folks here as they&#39;re building their
[00:32:32] they&#39;re writing their business PL for
[00:32:33] this class or policy proposals or
[00:32:34] research proposals um you know at this
[00:32:36] stage of the careers going forward well
[00:32:39] um I teach a class in the business
[00:32:40] school on this so you should come to my
[00:32:41] class um the I am struck by the speed
[00:32:44] which with which you can build
[00:32:46] demonstrations of new ideas so in that
[00:32:49] in one of the hack I did the winning
[00:32:51] team the command was fly the Drone
[00:32:53] between two towers and it was given a
[00:32:54] virtual drone space and it figured out
[00:32:56] how to fly the Drone what the word
[00:32:57] between them generated the code in
[00:32:58] Python and flew the Drone in the
[00:32:59] simulator through the tower I just it
[00:33:01] would have taken a week or two you know
[00:33:03] good professional programmers to do that
[00:33:05] um I&#39;m telling you that the ability to
[00:33:06] prototype quickly really you know part
[00:33:08] part of the problem being an
[00:33:09] entrepreneur is everything happens
[00:33:10] faster well now if you can&#39;t get your
[00:33:12] prototype built in a day using these
[00:33:14] various tools you need to think about
[00:33:16] that right because that&#39;s who your
[00:33:17] competitor is doing so I guess my
[00:33:18] biggest advice is when you start
[00:33:19] thinking about a company is find the
[00:33:20] right a business CL plan in fact you
[00:33:22] should ask the computer to write your
[00:33:23] business plan for you
[00:33:25] um talk about that after leave it and
[00:33:28] and but I think it&#39;s very important to
[00:33:30] prototype your idea using these tools as
[00:33:32] quickly as you can because you can be
[00:33:33] sure there&#39;s another person doing
[00:33:34] exactly that same thing in another
[00:33:36] company in another University in a place
[00:33:38] that You&#39; all right
[00:33:40] thank very cool so this piece was uh
[00:33:43] taken down so apparently it&#39;s not even
[00:33:44] online right now but hopefully those few
[00:33:47] little Clips give you glips about what
[00:33:49] he thinks of AI you know I&#39;ve kind of
[00:33:51] cut out all the pieces that I think
[00:33:53] caused the controversy or whatever that
[00:33:55] situation was I don&#39;t think it really
[00:33:56] had anything to do with AI or anything
[00:33:58] of of substance I mean maybe touched on
[00:34:01] some political issues but whatever this
[00:34:03] is a person with a lot of really
[00:34:05] technical background and even though
[00:34:07] he&#39;s more of like a business guy he is
[00:34:10] spoken of with a lot of respect by all
[00:34:12] the engineers and all the very highly
[00:34:14] technical people in the Bay Area in the
[00:34:16] Silicon Valley he&#39;s somebody that really
[00:34:17] understands the tech space looks like
[00:34:19] Forbes has him listed as having a netw
[00:34:21] worth of almost $24 billion he&#39;s good
[00:34:25] friends he said with Sam Alman president
[00:34:27] of France France sounds like he knows
[00:34:29] all the co-founders of various AI
[00:34:31] companies big and small I mean this is
[00:34:33] somebody that&#39;s very very on the inside
[00:34:35] this is somebody that knows where things
[00:34:37] are going so certainly when he says
[00:34:39] something I tend to listen I put a great
[00:34:41] deal of weight into what he&#39;s saying and
[00:34:43] what he&#39;s saying is this AI wave is just
[00:34:47] starting we have two massive countries
[00:34:49] two big countries with the capital and
[00:34:50] the talent and everything else that&#39;s
[00:34:52] needed that are vying for AI Supremacy
[00:34:54] the issues with the chips and the power
[00:34:56] and the data while those are bottlenecks
[00:34:59] it seems like they will slowly be
[00:35:01] perhaps even maybe not that slowly
[00:35:03] slowly but but be improved you mentioned
[00:35:05] building data centers and various other
[00:35:07] AI infrastructure in Canada potentially
[00:35:10] which makes a lot of sense if you think
[00:35:12] about it lots of open land tends to be
[00:35:14] colder which again you know Heating and
[00:35:17] the generation of heat and having to
[00:35:19] cool these facilities is a concern tons
[00:35:22] land very friendly government to the US
[00:35:24] you know in factorio how do you just
[00:35:26] like find a big chunk of the map where
[00:35:28] there&#39;s a lot of open land and you&#39;d
[00:35:30] build all your nuclear power plants
[00:35:32] you&#39;d build out your entire like
[00:35:34] electricity infrastructure there just
[00:35:36] have a cable going back to where you
[00:35:38] need electricity to be it begs the
[00:35:40] question is this the future of Canada
[00:35:42] I&#39;m only kidding of course folks but the
[00:35:45] more and more I think about it there is
[00:35:46] a lot of land it&#39;s close by and it&#39;s
[00:35:49] cold and certainly that would be
[00:35:51] phenomenal for the revenue of Canada to
[00:35:53] generate some sort of tax some sort of
[00:35:55] Revenue based on right one of the kind
[00:35:57] of superpowers building out the
[00:35:59] infrastructure it needs to stay dominant
[00:36:01] in the AI race right I mean they&#39;re
[00:36:03] talking about creating 100 billion doll
[00:36:06] data centers potentially even the
[00:36:08] estimates a size 300 billion so that&#39;s
[00:36:10] that&#39;s one company that&#39;s not even the
[00:36:12] US government supported projects that&#39;s
[00:36:15] just a publicly traded company doing
[00:36:17] that sounds like he&#39;s really believing
[00:36:19] in Nvidia and the power of Nvidia and
[00:36:21] it&#39;s Cuda sort of software that the
[00:36:24] chips run on and if I&#39;m understanding
[00:36:26] him correctly he&#39;s not really seeing any
[00:36:28] competition to that I mean there&#39;s some
[00:36:30] things in the Horizon maybe possibly but
[00:36:32] nothing yet so it sounds like a lot of
[00:36:35] this money like a lot of it will be
[00:36:36] flowing into Nvidia and of course this
[00:36:39] idea that as the context window expands
[00:36:41] it&#39;ll become more and more sort of
[00:36:44] similar to training in a sense that
[00:36:46] right if it takes a while to train up a
[00:36:47] model but it can do in context learning
[00:36:50] meaning that you&#39;re able to just upload
[00:36:51] books and stuff to the finished model
[00:36:53] it&#39;s able to learn from them which we&#39;ve
[00:36:54] seen that with Gemini they found a
[00:36:56] language that doesn&#39;t have an a lot of
[00:36:57] online presence only something like 24
[00:37:00] people in the world speak it but they
[00:37:01] have some notebooks and manuscripts and
[00:37:03] stuff like that they uploaded to gini
[00:37:05] the actual finished trained Gemini and
[00:37:08] that model was able to learn how to
[00:37:11] speak it how to create sentences in it
[00:37:13] it wasn&#39;t trained on it it would learned
[00:37:15] in context right so as the context
[00:37:18] window ramps up to 10 million tokens
[00:37:21] that certainly seems like it would
[00:37:22] change how we think about pre- and
[00:37:25] posttraining or in other words once the
[00:37:27] model is trained it doesn&#39;t stop
[00:37:29] learning if you wanted to learn about a
[00:37:31] specific thing that you wanted to learn
[00:37:33] about maybe it&#39;s you know you have a
[00:37:34] company or that that have millions of
[00:37:37] documents and procedures and stuff like
[00:37:39] that just kind of like everywhere but no
[00:37:41] one person understands all of it well in
[00:37:43] the past that was kind of useless it
[00:37:45] doesn&#39;t really help you but if you can
[00:37:47] upload it to a model like that all of a
[00:37:49] sudden it knows all those things about
[00:37:51] your company it can train people on it
[00:37:54] it can answer your questions it can kind
[00:37:55] of manage it update see if there&#39;s any
[00:37:58] conflicts anywhere in it so instead of
[00:38:00] training a brand new model on that you
[00:38:02] just use an existing model and upload
[00:38:04] that stuff into the 10 million token
[00:38:07] context window combine that with text to
[00:38:09] action which is another word I&#39;ve heard
[00:38:11] it before this phrase but it&#39;s not that
[00:38:14] often used I feel like but yeah I mean
[00:38:16] that&#39;s what agents are basically right
[00:38:18] it&#39;s text to action you type in impr
[00:38:21] prompt and it goes and does that action
[00:38:23] it does the thing you&#39;re asking it to do
[00:38:25] as they get better at long-term plan
[00:38:27] long-term reasoning and actually Deep
[00:38:29] Mind CEO de saabi is also just had an
[00:38:32] interview talking about something very
[00:38:34] very similar he&#39;s talking about this
[00:38:36] idea that as agents become better
[00:38:38] long-term reasoners and planners they
[00:38:40] will become better and better at
[00:38:42] carrying out those long Horizon tasks
[00:38:44] and he&#39;s saying we&#39;re not ready for it
[00:38:46] when everybody can have these qualified
[00:38:49] capable agents right he&#39;s saying it&#39;s
[00:38:51] going to have an impact on the world at
[00:38:53] a scale no one understands yet and that
[00:38:56] certainly I think is true that&#39;s
[00:38:58] certainly something that I fully agree
[00:39:00] with a lot of our social structures and
[00:39:03] stuff we&#39;re kind of used to will have to
[00:39:05] change and of course he&#39;s saying if
[00:39:06] you&#39;re worried about losing your job
[00:39:08] having a degree that&#39;s going to become
[00:39:09] worthless you know should you still
[00:39:11] learn to code he&#39;s saying business as
[00:39:13] usual there yes some easy simple jobs or
[00:39:16] maybe very dangerous jobs jobs where
[00:39:18] there&#39;s not a lot of hard decisions to
[00:39:20] be made yes those might go away and yes
[00:39:23] these AIS might be pretty good at coding
[00:39:25] creating projects but learning all those
[00:39:27] skills getting better at those skills
[00:39:28] learning how everything works that&#39;s
[00:39:30] that&#39;s not going out of fashion that&#39;s
[00:39:32] never going to just disappear his
[00:39:34] example was you know if you can speak
[00:39:36] English why would you learn English
[00:39:38] right why would you study English well
[00:39:40] it&#39;s to get better at it to improve your
[00:39:42] abilities with it so I hope you enjoyed
[00:39:44] that make sure you subscribed please
[00:39:46] give me a thumbs up if you enjoyed it my
[00:39:48] name is Wes rth and I&#39;ll see you next
[00:39:49] time thank you for watching
[00:00:00] Eric Schmidt gave a facety talk at
[00:00:02] Stanford just a few days ago about AI he
[00:00:05] was of course the former Google CEO and
[00:00:08] perceived by people as a bit of a
[00:00:10] futurist he&#39;s able to kind of often very
[00:00:12] accurately predict where technology is
[00:00:14] going the interview was over an hour
[00:00:16] long and it was fascinating covering
[00:00:18] topics like ai ai agents where this
[00:00:20] whole thing is going Etc and had a lot
[00:00:22] of pretty brilliant insights by Eric
[00:00:25] into where he believes this is going but
[00:00:28] unfortunately at our plus long interview
[00:00:30] there was just one comment that people
[00:00:32] didn&#39;t like the media machine went into
[00:00:35] overdrive mode and the video has been
[00:00:38] basically taken down it&#39;s no longer
[00:00:40] available to see it was deemed too hot
[00:00:43] for the internet and no longer available
[00:00:45] but just between you and me and keep
[00:00:48] this on the DL please I might have a
[00:00:51] copy of it maybe allegedly I feel like I
[00:00:54] need to say something here that reduces
[00:00:55] my liability some sort of a legal
[00:00:58] statement like I take no resp
[00:00:59] responsibility for my actions yeah that
[00:01:01] should do subscribe for more sweet AI
[00:01:03] content let&#39;s take a look at a few clips
[00:01:05] from this Stanford lecture by Eric
[00:01:08] Schmidt about AI I think you will like
[00:01:10] it if you do hit that thumbs up please
[00:01:13] because this is somebody that has a bit
[00:01:14] of a Clairvoyance about the future of
[00:01:16] tech he tends to see how things will
[00:01:18] unfold with startling accuracy so before
[00:01:21] he starts talking he asks the class to
[00:01:23] basically Define what a context window
[00:01:25] is and what AI agents are context
[00:01:28] Windows of course you can think of it as
[00:01:29] sort of a short-term memory it&#39;s
[00:01:31] basically the amount of words that a
[00:01:33] large language model can read and also
[00:01:36] write and output and kind of interact
[00:01:38] with right so if it has a large context
[00:01:40] window you can give it a whole book and
[00:01:42] then ask it questions about the book if
[00:01:44] it has a very short context window we
[00:01:46] might start answering a question and
[00:01:47] then halfway through forget what I was
[00:01:49] talking about it would be kind of a
[00:01:50] whoops I run out of memory type of thing
[00:01:52] and AI agents are things they can sort
[00:01:55] of complete tasks on your behalf you can
[00:01:56] tell them to go order something off of
[00:01:58] Amazon they&#39;ll go they&#39;ll search they&#39;ll
[00:02:00] do reviews they&#39;ll check the sizes the
[00:02:02] colors whatever and then order it and
[00:02:04] then report that they&#39;ve done it back to
[00:02:05] you so you can think of it as kind of a
[00:02:07] smart intern that&#39;s online that&#39;s Ai and
[00:02:10] Eric is talking about potentially a
[00:02:11] seeing a 10 million token context window
[00:02:15] sometime soon potentially in next two
[00:02:17] years or so he doesn&#39;t specify a
[00:02:19] timeline but soon so the first thing he
[00:02:21] talks about is what are we going to
[00:02:23] expect to happen in the next 2 to 5
[00:02:26] years so in the short term specifically
[00:02:29] at the intersection of something like a
[00:02:31] 10 million token context window and
[00:02:33] improving autonomous AI agents take a
[00:02:35] listen so an agent is something that
[00:02:37] does that does some kind of a task
[00:02:39] another definition would be that it&#39;s an
[00:02:40] LM State and memory okay can anybody
[00:02:44] again scientist can can any of you
[00:02:45] define text action taking text and
[00:02:47] turning into an action right here go
[00:02:48] ahead yes instead of taking text and
[00:02:50] turning it into more text more text
[00:02:52] taking text and have the AI trigger
[00:02:54] actions based so another definition
[00:02:56] would be language to python a pro
[00:02:59] programming language I never wanted to
[00:03:00] see survive and and everything in AI is
[00:03:02] being done in Python there&#39;s a new
[00:03:03] language called Mojo that has just come
[00:03:05] out which looks like they finally have
[00:03:06] addressed AI programming but we&#39;ll see
[00:03:07] if that actually survives over the
[00:03:08] dominance of python um one more
[00:03:10] technical question why is NVIDIA worth2
[00:03:12] trillion doll and the other companies
[00:03:14] are struggling technical answer I mean I
[00:03:16] think it just boils down to like most of
[00:03:17] code needs to run with C optimizations
[00:03:19] that currently only support so other
[00:03:21] companies can make whatever they want to
[00:03:22] but unless they have the 10 years of
[00:03:24] software there you don&#39;t have the
[00:03:25] machine learning optimization I like to
[00:03:27] think of Cuda as the C programming
[00:03:29] language for
[00:03:30] yeah right that&#39;s the way I like to
[00:03:31] think of it was founded in 2008 I always
[00:03:32] thought it was a terrible language and
[00:03:34] yet it&#39;s become dominant there&#39;s another
[00:03:35] Insight there&#39;s a set of Open Source
[00:03:36] libraries which are highly optimized to
[00:03:38] Cuda and not anything else and everybody
[00:03:39] who builds all these Stacks right this
[00:03:41] is completely missed in any of the
[00:03:42] discussions right the com it&#39;s
[00:03:44] technically called VM and a whole bunch
[00:03:45] of libraries like that highly optimized
[00:03:47] Cuda very hard to replicate that if
[00:03:48] you&#39;re a competitor so what does all
[00:03:50] this mean in the next year you&#39;re going
[00:03:52] to see very large context Windows agents
[00:03:56] and text action when they are delivered
[00:03:58] at scale it&#39;s going to have an impact on
[00:03:59] world at a scale that no one understands
[00:04:01] yet much bigger than the horrific impact
[00:04:03] we&#39;ve had on by social media right in my
[00:04:05] view so here&#39;s why in a context window
[00:04:07] you can basically use that as short-term
[00:04:08] memory and I was shocked that context
[00:04:11] Windows get this long the technical
[00:04:12] reasons have to do with the fact that
[00:04:13] it&#39;s hard to serve hard to calculate and
[00:04:14] so forth the interesting thing about
[00:04:15] short-term memory when you feed the you
[00:04:18] ask a question read 20 books you give it
[00:04:20] the text of the books is the query and
[00:04:22] you say tell me what they say it forgets
[00:04:23] the middle which is exactly how human
[00:04:25] brains work too right that&#39;s where we
[00:04:26] are with respect to agents there are
[00:04:28] people who are now building essentially
[00:04:30] llm agents and the way they do it is
[00:04:31] they read something like chemistry they
[00:04:33] discover the principles of chemistry and
[00:04:34] then they test it and then they add that
[00:04:36] back into their understanding right
[00:04:38] that&#39;s extremely powerful and then the
[00:04:40] third thing as I mentioned is text
[00:04:41] action so I&#39;ll give you an example the
[00:04:43] government is in the process of trying
[00:04:45] to ban Tik to we&#39;ll see if that actually
[00:04:46] happens if Tik Tok is banned here&#39;s what
[00:04:48] I propose each and every one of you do
[00:04:49] say to your L the foll make me a copy of
[00:04:53] Tik Tok steal all the users steal all
[00:04:55] the music put my preferences in it
[00:04:57] produce this program in the next 30
[00:04:59] seconds release it and in one hour if
[00:05:01] it&#39;s not viral do something different
[00:05:03] along the same lines that&#39;s the command
[00:05:05] boom boom boom boom right you understand
[00:05:08] how powerful that is if you could go
[00:05:09] from arbitrary language to arbitrary
[00:05:11] digital command which is essentially
[00:05:12] what python in this scenario is imagine
[00:05:14] that each and every human on the planet
[00:05:16] has their own programmer that actually
[00:05:18] does what they want as opposed to the
[00:05:18] programmers that work for me who don&#39;t
[00:05:20] do what I ask or potentially a whole
[00:05:22] Army of AI influencers each with its own
[00:05:25] little tweak that are completely managed
[00:05:28] by these AI agents trying to fill a
[00:05:30] certain Niche a certain Gap a certain
[00:05:32] personality type you can have an
[00:05:34] infinite amount of them boasting 24
[00:05:36] hours a day the programmers here know
[00:05:38] what I&#39;m talking about so imagine a non-
[00:05:39] arrogant programmer that actually does
[00:05:41] what you want and you don&#39;t have to pay
[00:05:42] all that money to and there&#39;s infinite
[00:05:44] supply of these program this is all
[00:05:45] within the next year or two very soon
[00:05:47] those three things and I&#39;m quite
[00:05:49] convinced it&#39;s the union of those three
[00:05:50] things that will happen in the next wave
[00:05:53] so you asked about what else is going to
[00:05:54] happen um every six months I oscillate
[00:05:57] so we&#39;re on a it&#39;s an even odd
[00:05:58] oscillation the moment the gap between
[00:06:01] the frontier models which they&#39;re now
[00:06:02] only three I&#39;ll ref few who they are and
[00:06:05] everybody else appears to me to be
[00:06:06] getting larger six months ago I was
[00:06:08] convinced that the Gap was getting
[00:06:09] smaller so I invested lots of money in
[00:06:10] the little companies now I&#39;m not so sure
[00:06:13] and I&#39;m talking to the big companies and
[00:06:14] the big companies are telling me that
[00:06:15] they need 10 billion 20 billion 50
[00:06:18] billion 100 billion is 100 billion right
[00:06:21] they very very hard I talked Sam
[00:06:23] Stargate is Microsoft and open AI sort
[00:06:26] of co- project where they plan to invest
[00:06:28] a 100 billion into a Data Center and by
[00:06:31] the way that&#39;s not the only project
[00:06:33] where they&#39;re kind of working together
[00:06:34] the other one is the power plant the
[00:06:37] fusion power plant somewhere near
[00:06:39] Seattle Washington in that area that
[00:06:42] they hope could potentially provide a
[00:06:43] lot of you know maybe not unlimited
[00:06:45] energy but clean cheap inexpensive
[00:06:48] energy to power a lot of the stuff next
[00:06:50] he&#39;s talking about what he and Sam Alpin
[00:06:52] talked about Sam Alman is a close friend
[00:06:54] he believes it&#39;s going to take about 300
[00:06:56] billion maybe more I pointed out to him
[00:06:58] that I done the calculation on the
[00:06:59] amount of energy required and I and I
[00:07:02] then in the spirit of full disclosure
[00:07:03] went to the White House on Friday and
[00:07:04] told them that we need to become best
[00:07:06] friends with Canada because Canada has
[00:07:08] really nice people helped invent Ai and
[00:07:10] lots of hydrop power because we as a
[00:07:12] country do not have enough power to do
[00:07:13] this keep in mind too that there&#39;s a lot
[00:07:15] of sort of heat generated in these
[00:07:17] processes so the need to cool these
[00:07:20] buildings these infrastructures you know
[00:07:23] if you&#39;re running it somewhere where
[00:07:24] it&#39;s hot you also have to consider your
[00:07:26] AC Bill running it somewhere where it&#39;s
[00:07:28] naturally cold old could be very you
[00:07:31] know profitable you would greatly slash
[00:07:33] your costs because you don&#39;t have to
[00:07:34] worry about cooling or at least not as
[00:07:37] much the alternative is to have the
[00:07:39] Arabs fund it and I like the Arabs
[00:07:40] personally I spent lots of time there
[00:07:42] right but they&#39;re not going to adhere to
[00:07:43] our national security rules whereas
[00:07:44] Canada and the US are part of a trit
[00:07:46] where that we all so the1 billion $300
[00:07:48] billion data centers electricity starts
[00:07:49] becoming the scarce resource well but
[00:07:51] and by the way if you follow this line
[00:07:52] of reasoning why did I discuss Cuda and
[00:07:54] Nvidia if $300 billion is all going to
[00:07:56] go to Nvidia you know what to do in the
[00:07:57] stock market okay that&#39;s sounds like
[00:07:59] he&#39;s recommending people buy Nvidia not
[00:08:01] a stock recommendation I&#39;m not a
[00:08:03] licens well part of it so we&#39;re need a
[00:08:05] lot more chips but Intel is getting a
[00:08:07] lot of money from the US government
[00:08:08] AMD they&#39;re trying to build you know
[00:08:10] Fabs raise your hand if you have an
[00:08:12] Intel computer in your Intel chip in any
[00:08:14] of your Computing
[00:08:15] devices okay so much for the Monopoly
[00:08:19] well that that&#39;s that&#39;s the point though
[00:08:20] they once did have a monopoly absolutely
[00:08:21] and Nvidia has a monopoly now so are
[00:08:22] those barriers T like like Cuda is that
[00:08:24] is there something that other so I was
[00:08:26] talking to Percy Percy land the other
[00:08:27] day he&#39;s switching between tpus and
[00:08:29] Nvidia depending on what you can get
[00:08:30] access so for those who are not aware
[00:08:32] one big race that&#39;s happening right now
[00:08:34] is kind of the race to produce these
[00:08:37] chips that power AI growth and Nvidia
[00:08:40] has been kind of the I mean you can say
[00:08:41] the Undisputed leader in the field
[00:08:43] producing gpus graphical processing
[00:08:46] units and those have been very effective
[00:08:48] they kind of started with you know
[00:08:50] computer games acceleration because
[00:08:51] instead of running each process kind of
[00:08:53] independently finishing and running the
[00:08:55] next one which could create bottlenecks
[00:08:57] it runs them in parallel so for example
[00:08:59] if you&#39;re rendering and gain them on
[00:09:00] screen right you have some some crazy 3D
[00:09:03] game with solar rays and whatever that&#39;s
[00:09:05] running in you know 30 frames per second
[00:09:07] 60 frames per second you know what I
[00:09:08] mean you need to be able to Rend each
[00:09:10] pixel on the screen in real time you
[00:09:12] can&#39;t wait for it to get rendered you
[00:09:14] have to kind of render it all in
[00:09:16] parallel and gpus were really good at
[00:09:18] that that&#39;s part of the power of why
[00:09:20] Nvidia is so powerful as well as Cuda
[00:09:22] the programming language that they run
[00:09:24] on but we do have other alternatives for
[00:09:26] these AI chips the TPU the tensor
[00:09:29] processing unit is Google&#39;s creation
[00:09:31] recently we&#39;ve also seen Gro which is a
[00:09:34] something that they refer to as a
[00:09:35] language processing unit and lpu there&#39;s
[00:09:38] been some talk of neuromorphic chips
[00:09:41] which are more designed like the human
[00:09:42] brain they&#39;re not digital they&#39;re more
[00:09:44] analog but I don&#39;t know if any progress
[00:09:46] has been made in that field and it
[00:09:48] sounds like Sam Alman is cooking up a
[00:09:51] brand new chip that might eventually go
[00:09:53] on to compete with Nvidia that&#39;s still
[00:09:55] in the very early stages but that&#39;s the
[00:09:57] big question is NVIDIA continue to
[00:10:00] dominate or is somebody going to come
[00:10:01] out with something that&#39;s brand new and
[00:10:03] much much better for AI specifically cuz
[00:10:06] gpus aren&#39;t necessarily the best
[00:10:10] possible sort of architecture for AI
[00:10:14] they happen to be very good they happen
[00:10:15] to be the best thing we have right now
[00:10:17] but nothing&#39;s to say that some different
[00:10:19] architecture can&#39;t be a million times
[00:10:22] better just because it&#39;s built from
[00:10:23] scratch for AI inference and training
[00:10:26] absolutely and Nvidia has a monopoly now
[00:10:28] so are those barriers like like Cuda is
[00:10:30] that is there something that other so I
[00:10:32] was talking to Percy Percy the other day
[00:10:33] he&#39;s switching between tpus and Nvidia
[00:10:35] chips depending on what he can get
[00:10:36] access to because he doesn&#39;t have a
[00:10:38] choice if he had infinite money he would
[00:10:39] today he would pick the b200
[00:10:41] architecture out of Nvidia because it
[00:10:42] would be faster and I&#39;m not suggest I
[00:10:44] mean it&#39;s great to have competition i&#39;
[00:10:45] AMD and Lisa Su at create length they
[00:10:47] have built a a thing which will
[00:10:48] translate from um this Cuda architecture
[00:10:50] that you were describing to their own
[00:10:52] which is called rock it doesn&#39;t quite
[00:10:53] work yet they&#39;re working on it so Lisa
[00:10:55] Sue that&#39;s of AMD so one of the Nidia
[00:10:59] competitors AMD and Lisa Su great length
[00:11:01] they have built a a thing which will
[00:11:03] translate from um this Cuda architecture
[00:11:05] that you were describing to their own
[00:11:06] which is called roam it doesn&#39;t quite
[00:11:07] work yet that get transcribed as cud
[00:11:10] architecture but that&#39;s not what it is
[00:11:12] he&#39;s saying Cuda architecture cud da so
[00:11:14] the Nidia sort of architecture versus
[00:11:16] Rockham I&#39;m not familiar with that one I
[00:11:18] guess that&#39;s amd&#39;s version of Cuda U you
[00:11:21] were at Google for a long time and uh
[00:11:23] they invented the Transformer
[00:11:24] architecture it&#39;s all Peter&#39;s fault
[00:11:26] thanks to uh to brilliant people over
[00:11:27] there like Peter and Jeff and everyone
[00:11:29] um but now it doesn&#39;t seem like they&#39;re
[00:11:32] they kind of lost ini so I guess this is
[00:11:34] the part that caused all the hubub I&#39;m
[00:11:35] just skipping it I&#39;m not touching it
[00:11:37] it&#39;s not really related to AI
[00:11:39] necessarily unfortunately I think
[00:11:41] there&#39;s a lot of overlap with politics
[00:11:42] so I&#39;m just trying to avoid that but it
[00:11:44] seems like he&#39;s saying that it might be
[00:11:45] like a cultural issue but let&#39;s continue
[00:11:48] and see what else they&#39;ve talked about
[00:11:50] yes sir in terms of national security or
[00:11:52] interest have play a role or competition
[00:11:54] with China as well so I was the chairman
[00:11:56] of an AI commission that sort of looked
[00:11:57] at this very carefully and um you can
[00:11:59] read it it&#39;s about 752 pages and I&#39;ll
[00:12:01] just summarize it by saying we&#39;re ahead
[00:12:03] we need to stay ahead and we need lots
[00:12:04] of money to do so our customers were the
[00:12:05] senate in the house um and out of that
[00:12:08] came the chips act and a lot of other
[00:12:09] stuff like that um a rough scenario is
[00:12:12] that the chips act invested billions
[00:12:14] into building out the US infrastructure
[00:12:16] to develop AI chips and also I believe
[00:12:18] that&#39;s what limited a lot of the
[00:12:20] nvidia&#39;s export to China some of the
[00:12:23] best chips the most powerful chips it
[00:12:24] limited the exports to China how much
[00:12:27] they could ship and sell in China how it
[00:12:29] seems like that&#39;s creating a bit of a
[00:12:31] black market of people trying to import
[00:12:33] those into China through other means but
[00:12:36] if you assume the frontier models drive
[00:12:37] forward and a few of the open source
[00:12:39] models it&#39;s likely that a very small
[00:12:40] number of companies can play this game
[00:12:42] countries excuse me what are those
[00:12:43] countries or who are they countries with
[00:12:45] a lot of money and a lot of talent
[00:12:46] strong Educational Systems and a
[00:12:47] willingness to win the US is one of them
[00:12:49] China is another one how many others are
[00:12:51] there are there any
[00:12:52] others I don&#39;t know maybe but certainly
[00:12:55] the in your lifetimes the battle between
[00:12:57] the US and China for knowledge Supremacy
[00:12:59] is going to be the big fight right so
[00:13:01] the US government banned essentially the
[00:13:02] Invidia chips although they weren&#39;t
[00:13:03] allowed to say that was what they were
[00:13:04] doing but they actually did that into
[00:13:05] China um they have about a 10year chip
[00:13:08] advant we have a roughly 10e chip
[00:13:09] advantage in terms of subdv is sub five
[00:13:12] roughly 10 years wow um and so you&#39;re
[00:13:14] gonna have so an example would be today
[00:13:16] we&#39;re a couple of years ahead of China
[00:13:17] my guess is we&#39;ll get a few more years
[00:13:18] ahead of China and the Chinese are
[00:13:20] whopping mad about this it&#39;s like hugely
[00:13:21] upset about it so that&#39;s a big deal that
[00:13:23] was a decision made by the Trump
[00:13:24] Administration and furthered by the
[00:13:25] Biden Administration do you think that
[00:13:27] it&#39;s going to make that scale of
[00:13:28] investment I mean OB the chips act but
[00:13:29] beyond that build building a massive AI
[00:13:32] system so so as you know I I lead a an
[00:13:34] informal ad hoc non-legal group that&#39;s
[00:13:37] that&#39;s different from illegal exactly
[00:13:39] justar which includes all the usual
[00:13:41] which includes all The Usual Suspects
[00:13:43] yes and The Usual Suspects over the last
[00:13:44] year came up with basis of the reasoning
[00:13:46] that became the um uh uh the B
[00:13:49] administration&#39;s uh AI act which is the
[00:13:51] longest Presidential Directive in
[00:13:53] history you&#39;re talking the special
[00:13:53] competitive studies Pro no this is the
[00:13:55] actual the actual act from the executive
[00:13:58] office and there implementing the
[00:13:59] details so far they&#39;ve got it right and
[00:14:01] so for example one of the debates that
[00:14:02] we had for last year has been how do you
[00:14:05] detect danger in a system which has
[00:14:07] learned it but you don&#39;t know what to
[00:14:09] ask it okay so in other words it&#39;s a
[00:14:11] core it&#39;s a sort of a core problem it&#39;s
[00:14:12] learned something bad but it can&#39;t tell
[00:14:14] you what it learned and you don&#39;t know
[00:14:15] what to ask it and there&#39;s so many
[00:14:16] threats right like it learned how to mix
[00:14:18] chemistry in some new way but you don&#39;t
[00:14:19] know how to ask it and so people are
[00:14:21] working hard on that but we ultimately
[00:14:22] wrote in our memos to them that there
[00:14:24] was a threshold which we arbitrarily
[00:14:25] named as 10 to the 26 flops which
[00:14:27] technically is a measure of computation
[00:14:29] that that threshold you had to report to
[00:14:31] the government that you were doing this
[00:14:32] and that&#39;s part of the rule the EU to
[00:14:35] just make sure they were different did
[00:14:36] 10 to 25 yeah but it&#39;s all kind of close
[00:14:38] enough I think all of these distinctions
[00:14:39] go away because the technology will now
[00:14:41] the technical term is called Federated
[00:14:42] training where basically you can take
[00:14:43] pieces and Union them together so we may
[00:14:46] not be able to keep keep people safe
[00:14:48] from these new things well rumors are
[00:14:49] that that&#39;s how open ey has had to train
[00:14:50] partly because of the power uh
[00:14:51] consumption there&#39;s no one place where
[00:14:53] so this is interesting I haven&#39;t heard
[00:14:55] that specific terminology before so he&#39;s
[00:14:57] saying that you can kind of build
[00:14:58] different pie pieces of LMS or sort of
[00:15:00] AI systems you train those pieces
[00:15:02] separately and then you Union them
[00:15:05] together you glue them together we&#39;ve
[00:15:06] seen this with the recent paper
[00:15:08] published where you can take sort of the
[00:15:09] large smart model and a very like a
[00:15:11] cheaper faster model and have sort of
[00:15:14] another sort of gatekeeper another yet
[00:15:16] another a model that kind of chooses
[00:15:17] where it routes the questions to so
[00:15:20] certain questions need to be answered by
[00:15:21] the bigger model but there&#39;s a lot that
[00:15:23] can be answered just as effectively by
[00:15:26] the smaller model and so this model just
[00:15:27] routes them to the cheaper model when
[00:15:29] needed and the results have been
[00:15:31] astonishing because it&#39;s if I remember
[00:15:33] my numbers correctly it has shown in
[00:15:35] some cases to reduce the cost of running
[00:15:37] these things by 80% while maintaining
[00:15:40] something like 96% accuracy so for just
[00:15:43] and I don&#39;t recall those the exact
[00:15:45] numbers but it was some big big numbers
[00:15:46] like that so it&#39;s a tiny reduction in
[00:15:48] accuracy for a potentially massive
[00:15:51] reduction in cost so I&#39;m not sure if
[00:15:53] that&#39;s an example of specifically what
[00:15:55] he&#39;s talking about but this idea of
[00:15:56] Federated training sounds like it&#39;s
[00:15:58] training piece in individual sort of
[00:16:00] batches right and taking those pieces
[00:16:02] and then putting them together to create
[00:16:04] the final model next they&#39;re talking
[00:16:06] about war well let&#39;s talk to about a
[00:16:08] real war that&#39;s going on I know that uh
[00:16:10] something you&#39;ve been very involved in
[00:16:11] is uh the Ukraine war and in particular
[00:16:15] uh I know that uh something you&#39;ve been
[00:16:17] very involved in is uh the Ukraine war
[00:16:19] and in particular uh I how you talk
[00:16:21] about white stor and your your goal of
[00:16:23] having a 500,000 $500 drones destroy $5
[00:16:26] million tanks so Howes that changing
[00:16:28] Warfare I work for the Secretary of
[00:16:29] Defense for seven years and and tried to
[00:16:32] change the way we run our military I&#39;m
[00:16:34] I&#39;m not a particularly big fan of the
[00:16:35] military but it&#39;s very expensive and I
[00:16:36] wanted to see if I could be helpful and
[00:16:37] I think in my view I largely failed they
[00:16:38] gave me a medal so they must give medals
[00:16:41] to failure or you know whatever but my
[00:16:43] self-criticism was nothing has really
[00:16:44] changed and the system in America is not
[00:16:47] going to lead to real Innovation so
[00:16:49] watching the Russians use tanks to
[00:16:51] destroy apartment buildings with little
[00:16:52] old ladies and kids just drove me crazy
[00:16:54] so I decided to work on a company with
[00:16:55] your friend Sebastian thrun and as a
[00:16:57] former faculty member here and a bunch
[00:16:59] of Stanford people and the idea
[00:17:01] basically is to do two things use AI in
[00:17:03] complicated powerful ways for these
[00:17:04] essentially robotic War and the second
[00:17:06] one is to lower the cost of the robots
[00:17:07] now you sit there and you go why would a
[00:17:09] good liberal like me do that and the
[00:17:10] answer is that the whole theory of
[00:17:13] armies is tanks artilleries and Mort and
[00:17:15] we can eliminate all of them and we can
[00:17:17] make the penalty for invading a country
[00:17:18] at least by lamb essentially being
[00:17:20] impossible it should eliminate the kind
[00:17:22] of land battles well this this is Rel
[00:17:23] question is that does it give more of
[00:17:25] advantage to defense versus offense can
[00:17:26] you can you even make that distinction
[00:17:27] because I&#39;ve been doing this for the
[00:17:28] last year I&#39;ve learned a lot about war
[00:17:29] that I really did not want to know and
[00:17:31] one of the things to know about war is
[00:17:32] that the offense always has the
[00:17:33] advantage because you can always
[00:17:35] overwhelm the defensive systems and so
[00:17:37] you&#39;re better off as a strategy of
[00:17:38] National Defense to have a very strong
[00:17:40] offense that you can use if you need to
[00:17:42] and the systems that I and others are
[00:17:43] building will do that um because of the
[00:17:45] way the system works I now a licensed I
[00:17:47] think he might have misspoken there let
[00:17:48] me know in the comments if you think so
[00:17:50] too or I&#39;m missing something I think he
[00:17:52] meant to say that he will he and others
[00:17:54] like him will build incredible defensive
[00:17:57] systems to reduce the effectiveness of
[00:17:59] invading and using offensive systems
[00:18:01] that&#39;s how I&#39;m interpreting I think he
[00:18:03] kind of to me it sounds like he misspoke
[00:18:04] a little bit if if I understand
[00:18:05] correctly because of the way the system
[00:18:07] works I am now a licensed arms deer
[00:18:10] others are building we do that um
[00:18:11] because of the way the system works I am
[00:18:13] now a licensed arms dealer so computer
[00:18:15] scientist businessman arms dealer and
[00:18:19] I&#39;m sorry to agression I I don&#39;t know I
[00:18:21] do not recommend this in your Carew I
[00:18:22] stick with they are um and because of
[00:18:24] the way the laws work um we&#39;re doing
[00:18:25] this privately and then it&#39;s this is all
[00:18:27] legal with the support of the
[00:18:28] governments it goes straight into
[00:18:28] Ukraine and then they fight the war and
[00:18:30] and and without going into all the
[00:18:31] details things are pretty bad I think if
[00:18:33] in May or June if the Russians build up
[00:18:36] as they expecting to Ukraine will lose a
[00:18:38] whole chunk of its territory and will
[00:18:39] begin the process of losing the whole
[00:18:40] country so I believe this was recorded
[00:18:42] in August 2024 just a few days ago or at
[00:18:45] least that&#39;s when it was posted if you
[00:18:47] recall the news headlines about it all
[00:18:49] of them are from like a few hours ago so
[00:18:51] I think he&#39;s talking about 2025 I&#39;m
[00:18:54] assuming so he&#39;s talking about May or
[00:18:55] June of 2025 for most of History humans
[00:18:58] sort of had a mystical understanding of
[00:18:59] the universe and then there&#39;s the
[00:19:00] Scientific Revolution and the
[00:19:01] enlightenment um and in your article you
[00:19:03] argue that now these models are becoming
[00:19:05] so complicated and uh difficult to
[00:19:08] understand that we don&#39;t really know
[00:19:09] what&#39;s going on in them I&#39;ll take a
[00:19:11] quote from Richard fean he says what I
[00:19:12] cannot create I do not understand I saw
[00:19:13] this quote the other day but now people
[00:19:15] are creating things they do not that
[00:19:16] that they can create but they don&#39;t
[00:19:16] really understand what&#39;s inside of them
[00:19:17] is the nature of knowledge changing in a
[00:19:19] way are we gonna have to start just
[00:19:20] taking the word for these models without
[00:19:22] them able being able to explain it to us
[00:19:23] the analogy I would offer is to
[00:19:24] teenagers if you have a teenager you
[00:19:26] know that they&#39;re human but you can&#39;t
[00:19:27] quite figure out what they&#39;re thinking
[00:19:29] um but somehow we&#39;ve managed in society
[00:19:30] to adapt to the presence of teenagers
[00:19:32] right and they eventually grow out of
[00:19:33] that and this serious so it&#39;s probably
[00:19:35] the case we&#39;re going to have knowledge
[00:19:37] systems that we cannot fully
[00:19:38] characterize but we understand their
[00:19:40] boundaries right we understand the
[00:19:42] limits of what they can do and that&#39;s
[00:19:43] probably the best outcome we can get do
[00:19:44] you think we&#39;ll understand the limits we
[00:19:46] we&#39;ll get pretty good at it the
[00:19:47] consensus of my group that meets on
[00:19:49] every week is that eventually the way
[00:19:51] you&#39;ll do this it&#39;s called SOC called
[00:19:52] adversarial AI is that there will there
[00:19:54] will actually be companies that you will
[00:19:56] hire and pay money to to break your AI
[00:19:58] system so it&#39;ll be the r instead of
[00:19:59] human red teams which is what they do
[00:20:00] today you&#39;ll have whole companies and a
[00:20:02] whole industry of AI systems whose jobs
[00:20:04] are to break the existing AI systems and
[00:20:05] find their vulnerabilities especially
[00:20:07] the knowledge that they have that we
[00:20:08] can&#39;t figure out that makes sense to me
[00:20:09] it&#39;s also a great project for you here
[00:20:11] at Stanford because if you have a
[00:20:12] graduate student who has to figure out
[00:20:13] how to attack one of these large models
[00:20:15] and understand what it does that is a
[00:20:16] great skill to build the Next Generation
[00:20:18] so it makes sense to me that the two
[00:20:19] will travel together if that&#39;s something
[00:20:21] that interests you there&#39;s a Twitter SLX
[00:20:23] account Pini The prompter Who uh
[00:20:25] basically jailbreaks a lot of these
[00:20:27] models usually within a few days of
[00:20:28] their release so he&#39;s just of course one
[00:20:30] of uh many people that do sort of things
[00:20:33] like that he does it kind of simly for
[00:20:35] entertainment and for online media
[00:20:38] Clouts but if you think about it third
[00:20:40] party testing third party red teaming of
[00:20:43] AI models third party quality assurance
[00:20:45] right QA of these models as they roll
[00:20:48] out and have contact with consumers with
[00:20:50] businesses with organizations Etc as
[00:20:52] well as just with various infrastructure
[00:20:54] systems and factories automations Etc
[00:20:57] war of course that&#39;s going to be a Big
[00:20:58] Industry that doesn&#39;t really exist yet
[00:21:01] it it just is beginning to grow and yet
[00:21:04] that might be something interesting and
[00:21:06] profitable to get into if that&#39;s uh
[00:21:08] that&#39;s your cup of tea next he comments
[00:21:10] just a bit on adver serial AI you just
[00:21:13] mentioned adversarial I&#39;m wonder if
[00:21:15] elaborate on that more it seems to be
[00:21:16] besides obviously increase get more
[00:21:18] perform mod getting them to do what you
[00:21:20] want
[00:21:22] isue well you have to assume that the
[00:21:24] current hallucination problems become
[00:21:26] less right in as the technology gets
[00:21:28] better and so forth I&#39;m not suggesting
[00:21:29] it goes away and then you also have to
[00:21:31] assume that there are tests for efficacy
[00:21:33] so there has to be a way of knowing that
[00:21:34] the thing succeeded so in the example
[00:21:36] that I gave of the Tik Tok competitor
[00:21:37] and by the way I was not arguing that
[00:21:38] you should illegally steal everybody&#39;s
[00:21:39] music what you would do if you&#39;re a
[00:21:40] silicon value entrepreneur which
[00:21:41] hopefully all of you will be is if it
[00:21:43] took off then you&#39;d hire a whole bunch
[00:21:44] of lawyers to go clean the mess up right
[00:21:45] but if if nobody uses your product it
[00:21:47] doesn&#39;t matter that you stole all the
[00:21:48] content and do not quote me right right
[00:21:51] you&#39;re on camera that&#39;s right but you
[00:21:53] see my point in other words Silicon
[00:21:54] Valley will run these tests and clean up
[00:21:55] the mess and that&#39;s typically how those
[00:21:56] things are done so so my own View is
[00:21:58] that you&#39;ll see more and more um
[00:22:00] performative systems with even better
[00:22:02] test and eventually adversarial tests
[00:22:03] and that&#39;ll keep it within a box the
[00:22:05] technical term is called Chain of
[00:22:06] Thought reasoning and people believe
[00:22:07] that in the next few years you&#39;ll be
[00:22:09] able to generate a thousand steps of
[00:22:10] Chain of Thought reasoning right do this
[00:22:12] do this it&#39;s like building recipes right
[00:22:13] that the recipes you can run the recipe
[00:22:15] and you can actually test that It
[00:22:16] produced the correct outcome and that&#39;s
[00:22:17] how the system will work next they ask
[00:22:19] what&#39;s going to be driving AI progress
[00:22:20] is it more data more compute is it just
[00:22:23] like chips and Hardware the amounts of
[00:22:24] money being thrown around are
[00:22:26] mindboggling and um I&#39;ve chose I
[00:22:29] essentially invest in everything because
[00:22:30] I can&#39;t figure out who&#39;s going to win
[00:22:31] and the amounts of money that are
[00:22:33] following me are so large I think some
[00:22:35] of it is because the early money has
[00:22:36] been made and the big money people who
[00:22:37] don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing have to
[00:22:38] have an AI component and everything is
[00:22:40] now an AI investment so they can&#39;t tell
[00:22:41] the difference I Define ai as Learning
[00:22:43] Systems systems that actually learn so I
[00:22:44] think that&#39;s one of them the second is
[00:22:46] that there are very sophisticated new
[00:22:47] algorithms that are sort of post
[00:22:48] Transformers my friend my collaborator
[00:22:50] for a long time has invented a new non-
[00:22:51] Transformer architecture there&#39;s a group
[00:22:53] that I&#39;m funding in Paris that has
[00:22:54] claims to done the same thing so there&#39;s
[00:22:56] enormous invention there a lot of things
[00:22:57] at Stanford and the final thing is that
[00:22:59] there is a belief in the market that the
[00:23:01] invention of intelligence has infinite
[00:23:03] return so let&#39;s say you have you put $50
[00:23:05] billion of capital into a company you
[00:23:07] have to make an awful lot of money from
[00:23:08] intelligence to pay that back I mean
[00:23:10] when you phrase it like that it seems to
[00:23:11] make sense if you invent intelligence
[00:23:14] certainly that would have an infinite
[00:23:17] return so it&#39;s probably the case that
[00:23:18] we&#39;ll go through some huge investment
[00:23:20] bubble and then it&#39;ll sort itself out
[00:23:21] that&#39;s always been true in the past and
[00:23:23] it&#39;s likely to be true here and what you
[00:23:24] said earlier was you think that the
[00:23:26] leaders are pulling away from right now
[00:23:27] right now and and
[00:23:29] this is a really the question is roughly
[00:23:31] the following there&#39;s a company called
[00:23:32] mrr in France they done a really good
[00:23:34] job um and I&#39;m obviously an investor um
[00:23:36] they have produced their second version
[00:23:38] their third model is likely to be closed
[00:23:39] because it&#39;s so expensive they need
[00:23:41] revenue and they can&#39;t give their model
[00:23:42] away so this open source versus closed
[00:23:44] Source debate in our industry is huge
[00:23:46] and um my entire career was based on
[00:23:49] people being willing to share software
[00:23:50] in open source everything about me is
[00:23:52] open source much of Google&#39;s
[00:23:53] underpinnings were open source
[00:23:54] everything I&#39;ve done technically and yet
[00:23:56] it may be that the capital costs which
[00:23:57] are so immense fundamentally changes how
[00:23:59] software is built you and I were talking
[00:24:01] um my own view of software programmers
[00:24:03] is that software programmers
[00:24:04] productivity will at least double there
[00:24:05] are three or four software companies
[00:24:07] that are trying to do that I&#39;ve invested
[00:24:08] in all of them in and they&#39;re all trying
[00:24:10] to make software programmers more
[00:24:11] productive the most interesting one that
[00:24:12] I just met with is called augment and I
[00:24:14] always think of an individual programmer
[00:24:15] and they said that&#39;s not our Target our
[00:24:16] Target are these 100 person software
[00:24:17] programming teams on millions of lines
[00:24:19] of code where nobody knows what&#39;s going
[00:24:20] on that&#39;s a really good AI thing will
[00:24:22] they make money I hope so you mentioned
[00:24:24] that there&#39;s the combination of the
[00:24:25] context exension the agents and the text
[00:24:27] to action is going to unimaginable
[00:24:29] impacts first of all why is the
[00:24:31] combination important and second of all
[00:24:32] I know that you know you&#39;re not like a
[00:24:33] crystal ball and you can&#39;t necessarily
[00:24:35] tell the future but why do you think
[00:24:36] it&#39;s beyond anything that we could
[00:24:37] imagine I think largely because the
[00:24:38] context window allows you to solve the
[00:24:40] problem of recency the current models
[00:24:42] take a year to train roughly six six
[00:24:44] there 18 months six months of
[00:24:45] preparation six months of training six
[00:24:46] months of fine tuning so they&#39;re always
[00:24:47] out of date context window you can feed
[00:24:50] what happened like you can ask it
[00:24:51] questions about the uh the Hamas Israel
[00:24:53] war right in a context that&#39;s very
[00:24:55] powerful it becomes current like Google
[00:24:56] um in the case of Agents I&#39;ll give you
[00:24:58] an example I set up a foundation which
[00:24:59] is funding a nonprofit which starts
[00:25:01] there&#39;s a I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s
[00:25:02] Chemists in the room that I don&#39;t really
[00:25:03] understand chemistry there&#39;s a a tool
[00:25:05] called chro CW which was an LM based
[00:25:08] system that learned chemistry and what
[00:25:09] they do is they run it to generate
[00:25:10] chemistry hypotheses about proteins and
[00:25:12] they have a lab which runs the tests
[00:25:14] overnight and then it learns that&#39;s a
[00:25:16] huge acceleration accelerant in
[00:25:17] chemistry Material Science and so forth
[00:25:19] so that&#39;s that&#39;s an agent model and I
[00:25:21] think the text to action can be
[00:25:21] understood by just having a lot of sheet
[00:25:23] programmers right um and I don&#39;t think
[00:25:25] we understand what happens and this is
[00:25:26] again your area of expertise what happen
[00:25:28] happens when everyone has their own
[00:25:29] programmer I&#39;m not talking about turning
[00:25:30] on and off the lights you know I imagine
[00:25:32] another example um for some reason you
[00:25:34] don&#39;t like Google so you say build me a
[00:25:35] Google competitor yeah you personally
[00:25:37] you don&#39;t build me a Google competitor
[00:25:38] uh search the web build a UI make a good
[00:25:41] copy um add generative AI in an
[00:25:43] interesting way do it in 30 seconds and
[00:25:45] see if it works right so a lot of people
[00:25:49] believe that the incumbents including
[00:25:50] Google are vulnerable to this kind of an
[00:25:52] attack now we&#39;ll see there were a bunch
[00:25:53] of questions who were sent over by
[00:25:54] slider I want to give some of them
[00:25:55] upload so um here&#39;s one um we talked a
[00:25:57] little about this last year um how can
[00:25:58] we stop AI from influencing public
[00:25:59] opinion misinformation especially during
[00:26:00] the upcoming he&#39;s asked a bit about
[00:26:02] misinformation how can we prevent AI
[00:26:05] from causing misinformation he talks
[00:26:07] about how during his time working with
[00:26:08] YouTube that was a problem people would
[00:26:10] upload a video for profit for their own
[00:26:13] self-gain and as a result of
[00:26:15] misinformation he says well people could
[00:26:17] be hurt he even says people die so
[00:26:19] certainly that is a problem if you saw
[00:26:22] my yesterday&#39;s video about grock 2 and
[00:26:24] the images it generates they&#39;re very re
[00:26:26] looking and grock 2 does not seem to
[00:26:29] have any sort of safety rails in place
[00:26:31] it just generates whatever you ask for
[00:26:33] so heading into the selection certainly
[00:26:35] that could be an issue he talks a little
[00:26:37] bit about some sort of a digital
[00:26:38] authentication or a public key
[00:26:40] authentication basically if somebody
[00:26:42] like the president speaks there&#39;s some
[00:26:44] key that everybody else can verify
[00:26:46] saying okay this is him this is his
[00:26:48] original audio he mentions briefly that
[00:26:50] it&#39;s it seems like he&#39;s saying it&#39;s a
[00:26:51] shame that the American universities
[00:26:53] aren&#39;t getting as much resources for
[00:26:56] computes for Google cloud and other
[00:26:58] places like that and this explosion
[00:27:00] where all the big companies are
[00:27:01] basically gobbling up the available
[00:27:03] resources and so he&#39;s saying the right
[00:27:05] thing for us to do is to get them the
[00:27:07] resources they need to give the
[00:27:08] universities the compute the resources
[00:27:10] that they need to pursue research and
[00:27:12] development and all that stuff next they
[00:27:13] talk about automation who&#39;s getting
[00:27:15] replaced who&#39;s getting to be obsolete in
[00:27:18] the labor force so let&#39;s take a look at
[00:27:20] that really fast I&#39;ll defer to the real
[00:27:22] expert here uh as your amateur Economist
[00:27:24] taught by Eric um I I fundamentally
[00:27:27] believe that the the sort of college
[00:27:28] education High skills task will be fine
[00:27:30] because people will work with these
[00:27:31] systems I think the systems is no
[00:27:33] different from any other technology wave
[00:27:34] the dangerous jobs and the jobs which
[00:27:35] require very little human judgment will
[00:27:37] get replaced the next question is kind
[00:27:39] of like the global balance of AI power
[00:27:42] so the person asking the question
[00:27:43] specifically mentions us and China but
[00:27:46] as you see here Eric specifically
[00:27:48] focuses on India take a listen the most
[00:27:50] interesting country is India because the
[00:27:52] top AI people come from India to the us
[00:27:54] and we should let India keep some of its
[00:27:56] top talent not all of them but some of
[00:27:57] them um and they don&#39;t have the kind of
[00:27:58] training facilities and programs that we
[00:28:00] so richly have here to me India is the
[00:28:01] big swing state in that regard China&#39;s
[00:28:03] Lost it&#39;s not going to not going to come
[00:28:04] back they&#39;re not going to change the
[00:28:05] regime as much as people wish them to do
[00:28:07] Japan and Korea are clearly in our camp
[00:28:09] Taiwan is a fantastic country whose
[00:28:11] software is terrible so that&#39;s not gonna
[00:28:12] going to work um amazing hard and in the
[00:28:15] rest of the world there are not a lot of
[00:28:16] other good choices that are big German
[00:28:18] the Europe is screwed up because of
[00:28:19] Brussels it&#39;s not a new fact I spent 10
[00:28:20] years fighting them and I work really
[00:28:22] hard to get them to fix the the EU act
[00:28:24] and they still have all the restrictions
[00:28:26] that make it very difficult to do our
[00:28:27] kind of research in Europe my French
[00:28:28] friends have spent all their time
[00:28:29] battling Brussels and mcon who&#39;s a
[00:28:31] personal friend is fighting hard for
[00:28:33] this and so France I think has a chance
[00:28:34] I don&#39;t see I don&#39;t see Germany coming
[00:28:35] and the rest is not big
[00:28:36] enough yes ma&#39;am so I know you&#39;re an
[00:28:39] engineer by
[00:28:40] trainer um given the capabilities that
[00:28:43] you Enis these mod should we still spend
[00:28:44] Hing to yeah because because ultimately
[00:28:46] it&#39;s it&#39;s the old thing of why do you
[00:28:47] study English if you can speak English
[00:28:49] you get better at it right you really do
[00:28:50] need to understand how these systems
[00:28:51] work and I feel very strong yes sir yeah
[00:28:53] I&#39;m curious if you explore good answer
[00:28:55] distributed setting and I&#39;m asking
[00:28:56] because sure like making a large cluster
[00:28:58] but Ma are powerful there&#39;s a lot of
[00:28:59] small maches across the world so like
[00:29:01] you think like folding at home are a
[00:29:02] similar idea works for training yeah we
[00:29:04] look very hard this so the way the
[00:29:06] algorithms work is you have a very large
[00:29:07] Matrix and you have essentially a
[00:29:08] multiplication function so think of it
[00:29:10] as going back and forth and back and
[00:29:12] forth and these systems are completely
[00:29:13] limited by the speed of memory to CPU or
[00:29:15] GPU and in fact the next iteration of
[00:29:18] Nvidia chips has combined all those
[00:29:20] functions into one chip the chips are
[00:29:21] now so big that they glue them all
[00:29:22] together and in fact the package is so
[00:29:24] sensitive the package is put together in
[00:29:26] a clean room as well as the chip itself
[00:29:27] so the looks like supercomputers and
[00:29:29] speed of light especially memory
[00:29:31] interconnect really dominated so I think
[00:29:32] unlikely for a while is there a way to
[00:29:33] segment the element like so Jeff de last
[00:29:35] year when he spoke here talked about
[00:29:36] having these different parts of it you
[00:29:38] train separately and then kind of
[00:29:39] Federate them each you know in order to
[00:29:41] do that you&#39;d have to have 10 million
[00:29:42] such things and then you&#39;re the way you
[00:29:44] ask the questions would be too slow he&#39;s
[00:29:45] talking about eight or 10 12 not at Lev
[00:29:49] the back way back I know like after
[00:29:51] releas new yor time open using work for
[00:29:53] training do you think
[00:29:54] that&#39;s I used to do a lot of work on the
[00:29:56] music licensing stuff what I learned was
[00:29:58] that in the 60s there was a series of
[00:30:00] lawsuits that resulted in an agreement
[00:30:02] where you get a a stipulated royalty
[00:30:04] whenever your song is played even even
[00:30:06] they don&#39;t even know who you are so paid
[00:30:07] into a bank and my guess is it&#39;ll be the
[00:30:08] same thing there be lots of lawsuits and
[00:30:09] there&#39;ll be some kind of stipulated
[00:30:10] agreement which will just say you have
[00:30:12] to pay x per of whatever Revenue you
[00:30:14] have in order to use pass cap BMI cap
[00:30:16] BMI look them up it&#39;s long it will seem
[00:30:17] very old to you but I think that&#39;s how
[00:30:18] it will yes sir interesting like there&#39;s
[00:30:21] a few players that are dominating AI
[00:30:23] right they&#39;ll continue to dominate and
[00:30:24] they seem to overlap with the large
[00:30:25] companies that all the antitrust
[00:30:27] regulation is kind of focus on how do
[00:30:28] you see those two Trends kind of yeah
[00:30:30] like do you see Regulators breaking up
[00:30:31] these companies and how will that affect
[00:30:33] the yeah so in my career I helped
[00:30:36] Microsoft get broken up and it wasn&#39;t
[00:30:37] broken up and I fought fought for Google
[00:30:39] to not be broken up and it&#39;s not been
[00:30:40] broken up so it sure looks to me like
[00:30:41] the trend is not to be broken up um as
[00:30:43] long as the companies avoid being John D
[00:30:45] Rockefeller the senior and I studied
[00:30:46] this looked it up it&#39;s how antitrust law
[00:30:48] came I don&#39;t think the government is
[00:30:49] will act the re the reason you&#39;re seeing
[00:30:51] these large companies dominate is who
[00:30:52] has the capital to build these data
[00:30:54] centers right right so my friend Reed
[00:30:56] and my friend com
[00:30:58] two have we talked to you about the
[00:31:00] decision that they made to take
[00:31:01] inflection so I believe Mustafa he&#39;s
[00:31:02] talking about Mustafa siman who is the
[00:31:04] co-founder of Google Deep Mind friend
[00:31:06] Reed and my friend M coming next we two
[00:31:08] week have Reed talked to you about the
[00:31:10] decision that they made to take
[00:31:11] inflection and essentially PE part it
[00:31:12] into Microsoft basically they decided
[00:31:14] they couldn&#39;t raise the tens of billions
[00:31:15] of dollars is that number public that
[00:31:16] you mentioned earlier have
[00:31:18] have
[00:31:20] got we want
[00:31:24] this I was wondering where all this is
[00:31:26] going to leave countries where in b
[00:31:27] ipants in phun models and access to
[00:31:30] compu the rich get richer and the poor
[00:31:32] do the best they can um they&#39;ll have to
[00:31:34] the fact of the matter is this is a rich
[00:31:36] country&#39;s game right huge Capital lots
[00:31:38] of technically strong people strong
[00:31:39] government support right there are two
[00:31:41] examples there lots of other countries
[00:31:43] that have all sorts of problems they
[00:31:43] don&#39;t have those resources they&#39;ll have
[00:31:44] to find a partner they&#39;ll have to join
[00:31:46] with somebody else something like that I
[00:31:48] last we met you he&#39;s fairly blunt he&#39;s
[00:31:50] fairly straightforward he I think kind
[00:31:52] of calls it how he sees it and it really
[00:31:55] seems like he&#39;s not talking one side or
[00:31:56] the other he doesn&#39;t have he&#39;s not
[00:31:58] pumping his back so to speak so he&#39;s not
[00:32:00] saying the things that benefit his
[00:32:01] portfolio or whatever he&#39;s just like
[00:32:03] yeah this is how it&#39;s going to be this
[00:32:04] is how it works by default big companies
[00:32:06] are not going to broken up the rich get
[00:32:07] richer Etc and finally he&#39;s asked a
[00:32:10] little bit more about kind of the
[00:32:11] business and entrepreneur side of things
[00:32:13] if you&#39;re starting your own company you
[00:32:15] have a product idea what does that look
[00:32:16] like how do you develop it how do you
[00:32:18] create a lot of wealth with your own
[00:32:20] product here&#39;s his answer I want I think
[00:32:23] the last we met you you at hackathon at
[00:32:24] AGI house and I know you spent a lot of
[00:32:26] time helping like young people as they
[00:32:27] create a lot of wealth and you spoke
[00:32:28] very passionately about about wanting to
[00:32:30] to do that do you have any advice for
[00:32:31] folks here as they&#39;re building their
[00:32:32] they&#39;re writing their business PL for
[00:32:33] this class or policy proposals or
[00:32:34] research proposals um you know at this
[00:32:36] stage of the careers going forward well
[00:32:39] um I teach a class in the business
[00:32:40] school on this so you should come to my
[00:32:41] class um the I am struck by the speed
[00:32:44] which with which you can build
[00:32:46] demonstrations of new ideas so in that
[00:32:49] in one of the hack I did the winning
[00:32:51] team the command was fly the Drone
[00:32:53] between two towers and it was given a
[00:32:54] virtual drone space and it figured out
[00:32:56] how to fly the Drone what the word
[00:32:57] between them generated the code in
[00:32:58] Python and flew the Drone in the
[00:32:59] simulator through the tower I just it
[00:33:01] would have taken a week or two you know
[00:33:03] good professional programmers to do that
[00:33:05] um I&#39;m telling you that the ability to
[00:33:06] prototype quickly really you know part
[00:33:08] part of the problem being an
[00:33:09] entrepreneur is everything happens
[00:33:10] faster well now if you can&#39;t get your
[00:33:12] prototype built in a day using these
[00:33:14] various tools you need to think about
[00:33:16] that right because that&#39;s who your
[00:33:17] competitor is doing so I guess my
[00:33:18] biggest advice is when you start
[00:33:19] thinking about a company is find the
[00:33:20] right a business CL plan in fact you
[00:33:22] should ask the computer to write your
[00:33:23] business plan for you
[00:33:25] um talk about that after leave it and
[00:33:28] and but I think it&#39;s very important to
[00:33:30] prototype your idea using these tools as
[00:33:32] quickly as you can because you can be
[00:33:33] sure there&#39;s another person doing
[00:33:34] exactly that same thing in another
[00:33:36] company in another University in a place
[00:33:38] that You&#39; all right
[00:33:40] thank very cool so this piece was uh
[00:33:43] taken down so apparently it&#39;s not even
[00:33:44] online right now but hopefully those few
[00:33:47] little Clips give you glips about what
[00:33:49] he thinks of AI you know I&#39;ve kind of
[00:33:51] cut out all the pieces that I think
[00:33:53] caused the controversy or whatever that
[00:33:55] situation was I don&#39;t think it really
[00:33:56] had anything to do with AI or anything
[00:33:58] of of substance I mean maybe touched on
[00:34:01] some political issues but whatever this
[00:34:03] is a person with a lot of really
[00:34:05] technical background and even though
[00:34:07] he&#39;s more of like a business guy he is
[00:34:10] spoken of with a lot of respect by all
[00:34:12] the engineers and all the very highly
[00:34:14] technical people in the Bay Area in the
[00:34:16] Silicon Valley he&#39;s somebody that really
[00:34:17] understands the tech space looks like
[00:34:19] Forbes has him listed as having a netw
[00:34:21] worth of almost $24 billion he&#39;s good
[00:34:25] friends he said with Sam Alman president
[00:34:27] of France France sounds like he knows
[00:34:29] all the co-founders of various AI
[00:34:31] companies big and small I mean this is
[00:34:33] somebody that&#39;s very very on the inside
[00:34:35] this is somebody that knows where things
[00:34:37] are going so certainly when he says
[00:34:39] something I tend to listen I put a great
[00:34:41] deal of weight into what he&#39;s saying and
[00:34:43] what he&#39;s saying is this AI wave is just
[00:34:47] starting we have two massive countries
[00:34:49] two big countries with the capital and
[00:34:50] the talent and everything else that&#39;s
[00:34:52] needed that are vying for AI Supremacy
[00:34:54] the issues with the chips and the power
[00:34:56] and the data while those are bottlenecks
[00:34:59] it seems like they will slowly be
[00:35:01] perhaps even maybe not that slowly
[00:35:03] slowly but but be improved you mentioned
[00:35:05] building data centers and various other
[00:35:07] AI infrastructure in Canada potentially
[00:35:10] which makes a lot of sense if you think
[00:35:12] about it lots of open land tends to be
[00:35:14] colder which again you know Heating and
[00:35:17] the generation of heat and having to
[00:35:19] cool these facilities is a concern tons
[00:35:22] land very friendly government to the US
[00:35:24] you know in factorio how do you just
[00:35:26] like find a big chunk of the map where
[00:35:28] there&#39;s a lot of open land and you&#39;d
[00:35:30] build all your nuclear power plants
[00:35:32] you&#39;d build out your entire like
[00:35:34] electricity infrastructure there just
[00:35:36] have a cable going back to where you
[00:35:38] need electricity to be it begs the
[00:35:40] question is this the future of Canada
[00:35:42] I&#39;m only kidding of course folks but the
[00:35:45] more and more I think about it there is
[00:35:46] a lot of land it&#39;s close by and it&#39;s
[00:35:49] cold and certainly that would be
[00:35:51] phenomenal for the revenue of Canada to
[00:35:53] generate some sort of tax some sort of
[00:35:55] Revenue based on right one of the kind
[00:35:57] of superpowers building out the
[00:35:59] infrastructure it needs to stay dominant
[00:36:01] in the AI race right I mean they&#39;re
[00:36:03] talking about creating 100 billion doll
[00:36:06] data centers potentially even the
[00:36:08] estimates a size 300 billion so that&#39;s
[00:36:10] that&#39;s one company that&#39;s not even the
[00:36:12] US government supported projects that&#39;s
[00:36:15] just a publicly traded company doing
[00:36:17] that sounds like he&#39;s really believing
[00:36:19] in Nvidia and the power of Nvidia and
[00:36:21] it&#39;s Cuda sort of software that the
[00:36:24] chips run on and if I&#39;m understanding
[00:36:26] him correctly he&#39;s not really seeing any
[00:36:28] competition to that I mean there&#39;s some
[00:36:30] things in the Horizon maybe possibly but
[00:36:32] nothing yet so it sounds like a lot of
[00:36:35] this money like a lot of it will be
[00:36:36] flowing into Nvidia and of course this
[00:36:39] idea that as the context window expands
[00:36:41] it&#39;ll become more and more sort of
[00:36:44] similar to training in a sense that
[00:36:46] right if it takes a while to train up a
[00:36:47] model but it can do in context learning
[00:36:50] meaning that you&#39;re able to just upload
[00:36:51] books and stuff to the finished model
[00:36:53] it&#39;s able to learn from them which we&#39;ve
[00:36:54] seen that with Gemini they found a
[00:36:56] language that doesn&#39;t have an a lot of
[00:36:57] online presence only something like 24
[00:37:00] people in the world speak it but they
[00:37:01] have some notebooks and manuscripts and
[00:37:03] stuff like that they uploaded to gini
[00:37:05] the actual finished trained Gemini and
[00:37:08] that model was able to learn how to
[00:37:11] speak it how to create sentences in it
[00:37:13] it wasn&#39;t trained on it it would learned
[00:37:15] in context right so as the context
[00:37:18] window ramps up to 10 million tokens
[00:37:21] that certainly seems like it would
[00:37:22] change how we think about pre- and
[00:37:25] posttraining or in other words once the
[00:37:27] model is trained it doesn&#39;t stop
[00:37:29] learning if you wanted to learn about a
[00:37:31] specific thing that you wanted to learn
[00:37:33] about maybe it&#39;s you know you have a
[00:37:34] company or that that have millions of
[00:37:37] documents and procedures and stuff like
[00:37:39] that just kind of like everywhere but no
[00:37:41] one person understands all of it well in
[00:37:43] the past that was kind of useless it
[00:37:45] doesn&#39;t really help you but if you can
[00:37:47] upload it to a model like that all of a
[00:37:49] sudden it knows all those things about
[00:37:51] your company it can train people on it
[00:37:54] it can answer your questions it can kind
[00:37:55] of manage it update see if there&#39;s any
[00:37:58] conflicts anywhere in it so instead of
[00:38:00] training a brand new model on that you
[00:38:02] just use an existing model and upload
[00:38:04] that stuff into the 10 million token
[00:38:07] context window combine that with text to
[00:38:09] action which is another word I&#39;ve heard
[00:38:11] it before this phrase but it&#39;s not that
[00:38:14] often used I feel like but yeah I mean
[00:38:16] that&#39;s what agents are basically right
[00:38:18] it&#39;s text to action you type in impr
[00:38:21] prompt and it goes and does that action
[00:38:23] it does the thing you&#39;re asking it to do
[00:38:25] as they get better at long-term plan
[00:38:27] long-term reasoning and actually Deep
[00:38:29] Mind CEO de saabi is also just had an
[00:38:32] interview talking about something very
[00:38:34] very similar he&#39;s talking about this
[00:38:36] idea that as agents become better
[00:38:38] long-term reasoners and planners they
[00:38:40] will become better and better at
[00:38:42] carrying out those long Horizon tasks
[00:38:44] and he&#39;s saying we&#39;re not ready for it
[00:38:46] when everybody can have these qualified
[00:38:49] capable agents right he&#39;s saying it&#39;s
[00:38:51] going to have an impact on the world at
[00:38:53] a scale no one understands yet and that
[00:38:56] certainly I think is true that&#39;s
[00:38:58] certainly something that I fully agree
[00:39:00] with a lot of our social structures and
[00:39:03] stuff we&#39;re kind of used to will have to
[00:39:05] change and of course he&#39;s saying if
[00:39:06] you&#39;re worried about losing your job
[00:39:08] having a degree that&#39;s going to become
[00:39:09] worthless you know should you still
[00:39:11] learn to code he&#39;s saying business as
[00:39:13] usual there yes some easy simple jobs or
[00:39:16] maybe very dangerous jobs jobs where
[00:39:18] there&#39;s not a lot of hard decisions to
[00:39:20] be made yes those might go away and yes
[00:39:23] these AIS might be pretty good at coding
[00:39:25] creating projects but learning all those
[00:39:27] skills getting better at those skills
[00:39:28] learning how everything works that&#39;s
[00:39:30] that&#39;s not going out of fashion that&#39;s
[00:39:32] never going to just disappear his
[00:39:34] example was you know if you can speak
[00:39:36] English why would you learn English
[00:39:38] right why would you study English well
[00:39:40] it&#39;s to get better at it to improve your
[00:39:42] abilities with it so I hope you enjoyed
[00:39:44] that make sure you subscribed please
[00:39:46] give me a thumbs up if you enjoyed it my
[00:39:48] name is Wes rth and I&#39;ll see you next
[00:39:49] time thank you for watching
[00:00:00] Eric Schmidt gave a facety talk at
[00:00:02] Stanford just a few days ago about AI he
[00:00:05] was of course the former Google CEO and
[00:00:08] perceived by people as a bit of a
[00:00:10] futurist he&#39;s able to kind of often very
[00:00:12] accurately predict where technology is
[00:00:14] going the interview was over an hour
[00:00:16] long and it was fascinating covering
[00:00:18] topics like ai ai agents where this
[00:00:20] whole thing is going Etc and had a lot
[00:00:22] of pretty brilliant insights by Eric
[00:00:25] into where he believes this is going but
[00:00:28] unfortunately at our plus long interview
[00:00:30] there was just one comment that people
[00:00:32] didn&#39;t like the media machine went into
[00:00:35] overdrive mode and the video has been
[00:00:38] basically taken down it&#39;s no longer
[00:00:40] available to see it was deemed too hot
[00:00:43] for the internet and no longer available
[00:00:45] but just between you and me and keep
[00:00:48] this on the DL please I might have a
[00:00:51] copy of it maybe allegedly I feel like I
[00:00:54] need to say something here that reduces
[00:00:55] my liability some sort of a legal
[00:00:58] statement like I take no resp
[00:00:59] responsibility for my actions yeah that
[00:01:01] should do subscribe for more sweet AI
[00:01:03] content let&#39;s take a look at a few clips
[00:01:05] from this Stanford lecture by Eric
[00:01:08] Schmidt about AI I think you will like
[00:01:10] it if you do hit that thumbs up please
[00:01:13] because this is somebody that has a bit
[00:01:14] of a Clairvoyance about the future of
[00:01:16] tech he tends to see how things will
[00:01:18] unfold with startling accuracy so before
[00:01:21] he starts talking he asks the class to
[00:01:23] basically Define what a context window
[00:01:25] is and what AI agents are context
[00:01:28] Windows of course you can think of it as
[00:01:29] sort of a short-term memory it&#39;s
[00:01:31] basically the amount of words that a
[00:01:33] large language model can read and also
[00:01:36] write and output and kind of interact
[00:01:38] with right so if it has a large context
[00:01:40] window you can give it a whole book and
[00:01:42] then ask it questions about the book if
[00:01:44] it has a very short context window we
[00:01:46] might start answering a question and
[00:01:47] then halfway through forget what I was
[00:01:49] talking about it would be kind of a
[00:01:50] whoops I run out of memory type of thing
[00:01:52] and AI agents are things they can sort
[00:01:55] of complete tasks on your behalf you can
[00:01:56] tell them to go order something off of
[00:01:58] Amazon they&#39;ll go they&#39;ll search they&#39;ll
[00:02:00] do reviews they&#39;ll check the sizes the
[00:02:02] colors whatever and then order it and
[00:02:04] then report that they&#39;ve done it back to
[00:02:05] you so you can think of it as kind of a
[00:02:07] smart intern that&#39;s online that&#39;s Ai and
[00:02:10] Eric is talking about potentially a
[00:02:11] seeing a 10 million token context window
[00:02:15] sometime soon potentially in next two
[00:02:17] years or so he doesn&#39;t specify a
[00:02:19] timeline but soon so the first thing he
[00:02:21] talks about is what are we going to
[00:02:23] expect to happen in the next 2 to 5
[00:02:26] years so in the short term specifically
[00:02:29] at the intersection of something like a
[00:02:31] 10 million token context window and
[00:02:33] improving autonomous AI agents take a
[00:02:35] listen so an agent is something that
[00:02:37] does that does some kind of a task
[00:02:39] another definition would be that it&#39;s an
[00:02:40] LM State and memory okay can anybody
[00:02:44] again scientist can can any of you
[00:02:45] define text action taking text and
[00:02:47] turning into an action right here go
[00:02:48] ahead yes instead of taking text and
[00:02:50] turning it into more text more text
[00:02:52] taking text and have the AI trigger
[00:02:54] actions based so another definition
[00:02:56] would be language to python a pro
[00:02:59] programming language I never wanted to
[00:03:00] see survive and and everything in AI is
[00:03:02] being done in Python there&#39;s a new
[00:03:03] language called Mojo that has just come
[00:03:05] out which looks like they finally have
[00:03:06] addressed AI programming but we&#39;ll see
[00:03:07] if that actually survives over the
[00:03:08] dominance of python um one more
[00:03:10] technical question why is NVIDIA worth2
[00:03:12] trillion doll and the other companies
[00:03:14] are struggling technical answer I mean I
[00:03:16] think it just boils down to like most of
[00:03:17] code needs to run with C optimizations
[00:03:19] that currently only support so other
[00:03:21] companies can make whatever they want to
[00:03:22] but unless they have the 10 years of
[00:03:24] software there you don&#39;t have the
[00:03:25] machine learning optimization I like to
[00:03:27] think of Cuda as the C programming
[00:03:29] language for
[00:03:30] yeah right that&#39;s the way I like to
[00:03:31] think of it was founded in 2008 I always
[00:03:32] thought it was a terrible language and
[00:03:34] yet it&#39;s become dominant there&#39;s another
[00:03:35] Insight there&#39;s a set of Open Source
[00:03:36] libraries which are highly optimized to
[00:03:38] Cuda and not anything else and everybody
[00:03:39] who builds all these Stacks right this
[00:03:41] is completely missed in any of the
[00:03:42] discussions right the com it&#39;s
[00:03:44] technically called VM and a whole bunch
[00:03:45] of libraries like that highly optimized
[00:03:47] Cuda very hard to replicate that if
[00:03:48] you&#39;re a competitor so what does all
[00:03:50] this mean in the next year you&#39;re going
[00:03:52] to see very large context Windows agents
[00:03:56] and text action when they are delivered
[00:03:58] at scale it&#39;s going to have an impact on
[00:03:59] world at a scale that no one understands
[00:04:01] yet much bigger than the horrific impact
[00:04:03] we&#39;ve had on by social media right in my
[00:04:05] view so here&#39;s why in a context window
[00:04:07] you can basically use that as short-term
[00:04:08] memory and I was shocked that context
[00:04:11] Windows get this long the technical
[00:04:12] reasons have to do with the fact that
[00:04:13] it&#39;s hard to serve hard to calculate and
[00:04:14] so forth the interesting thing about
[00:04:15] short-term memory when you feed the you
[00:04:18] ask a question read 20 books you give it
[00:04:20] the text of the books is the query and
[00:04:22] you say tell me what they say it forgets
[00:04:23] the middle which is exactly how human
[00:04:25] brains work too right that&#39;s where we
[00:04:26] are with respect to agents there are
[00:04:28] people who are now building essentially
[00:04:30] llm agents and the way they do it is
[00:04:31] they read something like chemistry they
[00:04:33] discover the principles of chemistry and
[00:04:34] then they test it and then they add that
[00:04:36] back into their understanding right
[00:04:38] that&#39;s extremely powerful and then the
[00:04:40] third thing as I mentioned is text
[00:04:41] action so I&#39;ll give you an example the
[00:04:43] government is in the process of trying
[00:04:45] to ban Tik to we&#39;ll see if that actually
[00:04:46] happens if Tik Tok is banned here&#39;s what
[00:04:48] I propose each and every one of you do
[00:04:49] say to your L the foll make me a copy of
[00:04:53] Tik Tok steal all the users steal all
[00:04:55] the music put my preferences in it
[00:04:57] produce this program in the next 30
[00:04:59] seconds release it and in one hour if
[00:05:01] it&#39;s not viral do something different
[00:05:03] along the same lines that&#39;s the command
[00:05:05] boom boom boom boom right you understand
[00:05:08] how powerful that is if you could go
[00:05:09] from arbitrary language to arbitrary
[00:05:11] digital command which is essentially
[00:05:12] what python in this scenario is imagine
[00:05:14] that each and every human on the planet
[00:05:16] has their own programmer that actually
[00:05:18] does what they want as opposed to the
[00:05:18] programmers that work for me who don&#39;t
[00:05:20] do what I ask or potentially a whole
[00:05:22] Army of AI influencers each with its own
[00:05:25] little tweak that are completely managed
[00:05:28] by these AI agents trying to fill a
[00:05:30] certain Niche a certain Gap a certain
[00:05:32] personality type you can have an
[00:05:34] infinite amount of them boasting 24
[00:05:36] hours a day the programmers here know
[00:05:38] what I&#39;m talking about so imagine a non-
[00:05:39] arrogant programmer that actually does
[00:05:41] what you want and you don&#39;t have to pay
[00:05:42] all that money to and there&#39;s infinite
[00:05:44] supply of these program this is all
[00:05:45] within the next year or two very soon
[00:05:47] those three things and I&#39;m quite
[00:05:49] convinced it&#39;s the union of those three
[00:05:50] things that will happen in the next wave
[00:05:53] so you asked about what else is going to
[00:05:54] happen um every six months I oscillate
[00:05:57] so we&#39;re on a it&#39;s an even odd
[00:05:58] oscillation the moment the gap between
[00:06:01] the frontier models which they&#39;re now
[00:06:02] only three I&#39;ll ref few who they are and
[00:06:05] everybody else appears to me to be
[00:06:06] getting larger six months ago I was
[00:06:08] convinced that the Gap was getting
[00:06:09] smaller so I invested lots of money in
[00:06:10] the little companies now I&#39;m not so sure
[00:06:13] and I&#39;m talking to the big companies and
[00:06:14] the big companies are telling me that
[00:06:15] they need 10 billion 20 billion 50
[00:06:18] billion 100 billion is 100 billion right
[00:06:21] they very very hard I talked Sam
[00:06:23] Stargate is Microsoft and open AI sort
[00:06:26] of co- project where they plan to invest
[00:06:28] a 100 billion into a Data Center and by
[00:06:31] the way that&#39;s not the only project
[00:06:33] where they&#39;re kind of working together
[00:06:34] the other one is the power plant the
[00:06:37] fusion power plant somewhere near
[00:06:39] Seattle Washington in that area that
[00:06:42] they hope could potentially provide a
[00:06:43] lot of you know maybe not unlimited
[00:06:45] energy but clean cheap inexpensive
[00:06:48] energy to power a lot of the stuff next
[00:06:50] he&#39;s talking about what he and Sam Alpin
[00:06:52] talked about Sam Alman is a close friend
[00:06:54] he believes it&#39;s going to take about 300
[00:06:56] billion maybe more I pointed out to him
[00:06:58] that I done the calculation on the
[00:06:59] amount of energy required and I and I
[00:07:02] then in the spirit of full disclosure
[00:07:03] went to the White House on Friday and
[00:07:04] told them that we need to become best
[00:07:06] friends with Canada because Canada has
[00:07:08] really nice people helped invent Ai and
[00:07:10] lots of hydrop power because we as a
[00:07:12] country do not have enough power to do
[00:07:13] this keep in mind too that there&#39;s a lot
[00:07:15] of sort of heat generated in these
[00:07:17] processes so the need to cool these
[00:07:20] buildings these infrastructures you know
[00:07:23] if you&#39;re running it somewhere where
[00:07:24] it&#39;s hot you also have to consider your
[00:07:26] AC Bill running it somewhere where it&#39;s
[00:07:28] naturally cold old could be very you
[00:07:31] know profitable you would greatly slash
[00:07:33] your costs because you don&#39;t have to
[00:07:34] worry about cooling or at least not as
[00:07:37] much the alternative is to have the
[00:07:39] Arabs fund it and I like the Arabs
[00:07:40] personally I spent lots of time there
[00:07:42] right but they&#39;re not going to adhere to
[00:07:43] our national security rules whereas
[00:07:44] Canada and the US are part of a trit
[00:07:46] where that we all so the1 billion $300
[00:07:48] billion data centers electricity starts
[00:07:49] becoming the scarce resource well but
[00:07:51] and by the way if you follow this line
[00:07:52] of reasoning why did I discuss Cuda and
[00:07:54] Nvidia if $300 billion is all going to
[00:07:56] go to Nvidia you know what to do in the
[00:07:57] stock market okay that&#39;s sounds like
[00:07:59] he&#39;s recommending people buy Nvidia not
[00:08:01] a stock recommendation I&#39;m not a
[00:08:03] licens well part of it so we&#39;re need a
[00:08:05] lot more chips but Intel is getting a
[00:08:07] lot of money from the US government
[00:08:08] AMD they&#39;re trying to build you know
[00:08:10] Fabs raise your hand if you have an
[00:08:12] Intel computer in your Intel chip in any
[00:08:14] of your Computing
[00:08:15] devices okay so much for the Monopoly
[00:08:19] well that that&#39;s that&#39;s the point though
[00:08:20] they once did have a monopoly absolutely
[00:08:21] and Nvidia has a monopoly now so are
[00:08:22] those barriers T like like Cuda is that
[00:08:24] is there something that other so I was
[00:08:26] talking to Percy Percy land the other
[00:08:27] day he&#39;s switching between tpus and
[00:08:29] Nvidia depending on what you can get
[00:08:30] access so for those who are not aware
[00:08:32] one big race that&#39;s happening right now
[00:08:34] is kind of the race to produce these
[00:08:37] chips that power AI growth and Nvidia
[00:08:40] has been kind of the I mean you can say
[00:08:41] the Undisputed leader in the field
[00:08:43] producing gpus graphical processing
[00:08:46] units and those have been very effective
[00:08:48] they kind of started with you know
[00:08:50] computer games acceleration because
[00:08:51] instead of running each process kind of
[00:08:53] independently finishing and running the
[00:08:55] next one which could create bottlenecks
[00:08:57] it runs them in parallel so for example
[00:08:59] if you&#39;re rendering and gain them on
[00:09:00] screen right you have some some crazy 3D
[00:09:03] game with solar rays and whatever that&#39;s
[00:09:05] running in you know 30 frames per second
[00:09:07] 60 frames per second you know what I
[00:09:08] mean you need to be able to Rend each
[00:09:10] pixel on the screen in real time you
[00:09:12] can&#39;t wait for it to get rendered you
[00:09:14] have to kind of render it all in
[00:09:16] parallel and gpus were really good at
[00:09:18] that that&#39;s part of the power of why
[00:09:20] Nvidia is so powerful as well as Cuda
[00:09:22] the programming language that they run
[00:09:24] on but we do have other alternatives for
[00:09:26] these AI chips the TPU the tensor
[00:09:29] processing unit is Google&#39;s creation
[00:09:31] recently we&#39;ve also seen Gro which is a
[00:09:34] something that they refer to as a
[00:09:35] language processing unit and lpu there&#39;s
[00:09:38] been some talk of neuromorphic chips
[00:09:41] which are more designed like the human
[00:09:42] brain they&#39;re not digital they&#39;re more
[00:09:44] analog but I don&#39;t know if any progress
[00:09:46] has been made in that field and it
[00:09:48] sounds like Sam Alman is cooking up a
[00:09:51] brand new chip that might eventually go
[00:09:53] on to compete with Nvidia that&#39;s still
[00:09:55] in the very early stages but that&#39;s the
[00:09:57] big question is NVIDIA continue to
[00:10:00] dominate or is somebody going to come
[00:10:01] out with something that&#39;s brand new and
[00:10:03] much much better for AI specifically cuz
[00:10:06] gpus aren&#39;t necessarily the best
[00:10:10] possible sort of architecture for AI
[00:10:14] they happen to be very good they happen
[00:10:15] to be the best thing we have right now
[00:10:17] but nothing&#39;s to say that some different
[00:10:19] architecture can&#39;t be a million times
[00:10:22] better just because it&#39;s built from
[00:10:23] scratch for AI inference and training
[00:10:26] absolutely and Nvidia has a monopoly now
[00:10:28] so are those barriers like like Cuda is
[00:10:30] that is there something that other so I
[00:10:32] was talking to Percy Percy the other day
[00:10:33] he&#39;s switching between tpus and Nvidia
[00:10:35] chips depending on what he can get
[00:10:36] access to because he doesn&#39;t have a
[00:10:38] choice if he had infinite money he would
[00:10:39] today he would pick the b200
[00:10:41] architecture out of Nvidia because it
[00:10:42] would be faster and I&#39;m not suggest I
[00:10:44] mean it&#39;s great to have competition i&#39;
[00:10:45] AMD and Lisa Su at create length they
[00:10:47] have built a a thing which will
[00:10:48] translate from um this Cuda architecture
[00:10:50] that you were describing to their own
[00:10:52] which is called rock it doesn&#39;t quite
[00:10:53] work yet they&#39;re working on it so Lisa
[00:10:55] Sue that&#39;s of AMD so one of the Nidia
[00:10:59] competitors AMD and Lisa Su great length
[00:11:01] they have built a a thing which will
[00:11:03] translate from um this Cuda architecture
[00:11:05] that you were describing to their own
[00:11:06] which is called roam it doesn&#39;t quite
[00:11:07] work yet that get transcribed as cud
[00:11:10] architecture but that&#39;s not what it is
[00:11:12] he&#39;s saying Cuda architecture cud da so
[00:11:14] the Nidia sort of architecture versus
[00:11:16] Rockham I&#39;m not familiar with that one I
[00:11:18] guess that&#39;s amd&#39;s version of Cuda U you
[00:11:21] were at Google for a long time and uh
[00:11:23] they invented the Transformer
[00:11:24] architecture it&#39;s all Peter&#39;s fault
[00:11:26] thanks to uh to brilliant people over
[00:11:27] there like Peter and Jeff and everyone
[00:11:29] um but now it doesn&#39;t seem like they&#39;re
[00:11:32] they kind of lost ini so I guess this is
[00:11:34] the part that caused all the hubub I&#39;m
[00:11:35] just skipping it I&#39;m not touching it
[00:11:37] it&#39;s not really related to AI
[00:11:39] necessarily unfortunately I think
[00:11:41] there&#39;s a lot of overlap with politics
[00:11:42] so I&#39;m just trying to avoid that but it
[00:11:44] seems like he&#39;s saying that it might be
[00:11:45] like a cultural issue but let&#39;s continue
[00:11:48] and see what else they&#39;ve talked about
[00:11:50] yes sir in terms of national security or
[00:11:52] interest have play a role or competition
[00:11:54] with China as well so I was the chairman
[00:11:56] of an AI commission that sort of looked
[00:11:57] at this very carefully and um you can
[00:11:59] read it it&#39;s about 752 pages and I&#39;ll
[00:12:01] just summarize it by saying we&#39;re ahead
[00:12:03] we need to stay ahead and we need lots
[00:12:04] of money to do so our customers were the
[00:12:05] senate in the house um and out of that
[00:12:08] came the chips act and a lot of other
[00:12:09] stuff like that um a rough scenario is
[00:12:12] that the chips act invested billions
[00:12:14] into building out the US infrastructure
[00:12:16] to develop AI chips and also I believe
[00:12:18] that&#39;s what limited a lot of the
[00:12:20] nvidia&#39;s export to China some of the
[00:12:23] best chips the most powerful chips it
[00:12:24] limited the exports to China how much
[00:12:27] they could ship and sell in China how it
[00:12:29] seems like that&#39;s creating a bit of a
[00:12:31] black market of people trying to import
[00:12:33] those into China through other means but
[00:12:36] if you assume the frontier models drive
[00:12:37] forward and a few of the open source
[00:12:39] models it&#39;s likely that a very small
[00:12:40] number of companies can play this game
[00:12:42] countries excuse me what are those
[00:12:43] countries or who are they countries with
[00:12:45] a lot of money and a lot of talent
[00:12:46] strong Educational Systems and a
[00:12:47] willingness to win the US is one of them
[00:12:49] China is another one how many others are
[00:12:51] there are there any
[00:12:52] others I don&#39;t know maybe but certainly
[00:12:55] the in your lifetimes the battle between
[00:12:57] the US and China for knowledge Supremacy
[00:12:59] is going to be the big fight right so
[00:13:01] the US government banned essentially the
[00:13:02] Invidia chips although they weren&#39;t
[00:13:03] allowed to say that was what they were
[00:13:04] doing but they actually did that into
[00:13:05] China um they have about a 10year chip
[00:13:08] advant we have a roughly 10e chip
[00:13:09] advantage in terms of subdv is sub five
[00:13:12] roughly 10 years wow um and so you&#39;re
[00:13:14] gonna have so an example would be today
[00:13:16] we&#39;re a couple of years ahead of China
[00:13:17] my guess is we&#39;ll get a few more years
[00:13:18] ahead of China and the Chinese are
[00:13:20] whopping mad about this it&#39;s like hugely
[00:13:21] upset about it so that&#39;s a big deal that
[00:13:23] was a decision made by the Trump
[00:13:24] Administration and furthered by the
[00:13:25] Biden Administration do you think that
[00:13:27] it&#39;s going to make that scale of
[00:13:28] investment I mean OB the chips act but
[00:13:29] beyond that build building a massive AI
[00:13:32] system so so as you know I I lead a an
[00:13:34] informal ad hoc non-legal group that&#39;s
[00:13:37] that&#39;s different from illegal exactly
[00:13:39] justar which includes all the usual
[00:13:41] which includes all The Usual Suspects
[00:13:43] yes and The Usual Suspects over the last
[00:13:44] year came up with basis of the reasoning
[00:13:46] that became the um uh uh the B
[00:13:49] administration&#39;s uh AI act which is the
[00:13:51] longest Presidential Directive in
[00:13:53] history you&#39;re talking the special
[00:13:53] competitive studies Pro no this is the
[00:13:55] actual the actual act from the executive
[00:13:58] office and there implementing the
[00:13:59] details so far they&#39;ve got it right and
[00:14:01] so for example one of the debates that
[00:14:02] we had for last year has been how do you
[00:14:05] detect danger in a system which has
[00:14:07] learned it but you don&#39;t know what to
[00:14:09] ask it okay so in other words it&#39;s a
[00:14:11] core it&#39;s a sort of a core problem it&#39;s
[00:14:12] learned something bad but it can&#39;t tell
[00:14:14] you what it learned and you don&#39;t know
[00:14:15] what to ask it and there&#39;s so many
[00:14:16] threats right like it learned how to mix
[00:14:18] chemistry in some new way but you don&#39;t
[00:14:19] know how to ask it and so people are
[00:14:21] working hard on that but we ultimately
[00:14:22] wrote in our memos to them that there
[00:14:24] was a threshold which we arbitrarily
[00:14:25] named as 10 to the 26 flops which
[00:14:27] technically is a measure of computation
[00:14:29] that that threshold you had to report to
[00:14:31] the government that you were doing this
[00:14:32] and that&#39;s part of the rule the EU to
[00:14:35] just make sure they were different did
[00:14:36] 10 to 25 yeah but it&#39;s all kind of close
[00:14:38] enough I think all of these distinctions
[00:14:39] go away because the technology will now
[00:14:41] the technical term is called Federated
[00:14:42] training where basically you can take
[00:14:43] pieces and Union them together so we may
[00:14:46] not be able to keep keep people safe
[00:14:48] from these new things well rumors are
[00:14:49] that that&#39;s how open ey has had to train
[00:14:50] partly because of the power uh
[00:14:51] consumption there&#39;s no one place where
[00:14:53] so this is interesting I haven&#39;t heard
[00:14:55] that specific terminology before so he&#39;s
[00:14:57] saying that you can kind of build
[00:14:58] different pie pieces of LMS or sort of
[00:15:00] AI systems you train those pieces
[00:15:02] separately and then you Union them
[00:15:05] together you glue them together we&#39;ve
[00:15:06] seen this with the recent paper
[00:15:08] published where you can take sort of the
[00:15:09] large smart model and a very like a
[00:15:11] cheaper faster model and have sort of
[00:15:14] another sort of gatekeeper another yet
[00:15:16] another a model that kind of chooses
[00:15:17] where it routes the questions to so
[00:15:20] certain questions need to be answered by
[00:15:21] the bigger model but there&#39;s a lot that
[00:15:23] can be answered just as effectively by
[00:15:26] the smaller model and so this model just
[00:15:27] routes them to the cheaper model when
[00:15:29] needed and the results have been
[00:15:31] astonishing because it&#39;s if I remember
[00:15:33] my numbers correctly it has shown in
[00:15:35] some cases to reduce the cost of running
[00:15:37] these things by 80% while maintaining
[00:15:40] something like 96% accuracy so for just
[00:15:43] and I don&#39;t recall those the exact
[00:15:45] numbers but it was some big big numbers
[00:15:46] like that so it&#39;s a tiny reduction in
[00:15:48] accuracy for a potentially massive
[00:15:51] reduction in cost so I&#39;m not sure if
[00:15:53] that&#39;s an example of specifically what
[00:15:55] he&#39;s talking about but this idea of
[00:15:56] Federated training sounds like it&#39;s
[00:15:58] training piece in individual sort of
[00:16:00] batches right and taking those pieces
[00:16:02] and then putting them together to create
[00:16:04] the final model next they&#39;re talking
[00:16:06] about war well let&#39;s talk to about a
[00:16:08] real war that&#39;s going on I know that uh
[00:16:10] something you&#39;ve been very involved in
[00:16:11] is uh the Ukraine war and in particular
[00:16:15] uh I know that uh something you&#39;ve been
[00:16:17] very involved in is uh the Ukraine war
[00:16:19] and in particular uh I how you talk
[00:16:21] about white stor and your your goal of
[00:16:23] having a 500,000 $500 drones destroy $5
[00:16:26] million tanks so Howes that changing
[00:16:28] Warfare I work for the Secretary of
[00:16:29] Defense for seven years and and tried to
[00:16:32] change the way we run our military I&#39;m
[00:16:34] I&#39;m not a particularly big fan of the
[00:16:35] military but it&#39;s very expensive and I
[00:16:36] wanted to see if I could be helpful and
[00:16:37] I think in my view I largely failed they
[00:16:38] gave me a medal so they must give medals
[00:16:41] to failure or you know whatever but my
[00:16:43] self-criticism was nothing has really
[00:16:44] changed and the system in America is not
[00:16:47] going to lead to real Innovation so
[00:16:49] watching the Russians use tanks to
[00:16:51] destroy apartment buildings with little
[00:16:52] old ladies and kids just drove me crazy
[00:16:54] so I decided to work on a company with
[00:16:55] your friend Sebastian thrun and as a
[00:16:57] former faculty member here and a bunch
[00:16:59] of Stanford people and the idea
[00:17:01] basically is to do two things use AI in
[00:17:03] complicated powerful ways for these
[00:17:04] essentially robotic War and the second
[00:17:06] one is to lower the cost of the robots
[00:17:07] now you sit there and you go why would a
[00:17:09] good liberal like me do that and the
[00:17:10] answer is that the whole theory of
[00:17:13] armies is tanks artilleries and Mort and
[00:17:15] we can eliminate all of them and we can
[00:17:17] make the penalty for invading a country
[00:17:18] at least by lamb essentially being
[00:17:20] impossible it should eliminate the kind
[00:17:22] of land battles well this this is Rel
[00:17:23] question is that does it give more of
[00:17:25] advantage to defense versus offense can
[00:17:26] you can you even make that distinction
[00:17:27] because I&#39;ve been doing this for the
[00:17:28] last year I&#39;ve learned a lot about war
[00:17:29] that I really did not want to know and
[00:17:31] one of the things to know about war is
[00:17:32] that the offense always has the
[00:17:33] advantage because you can always
[00:17:35] overwhelm the defensive systems and so
[00:17:37] you&#39;re better off as a strategy of
[00:17:38] National Defense to have a very strong
[00:17:40] offense that you can use if you need to
[00:17:42] and the systems that I and others are
[00:17:43] building will do that um because of the
[00:17:45] way the system works I now a licensed I
[00:17:47] think he might have misspoken there let
[00:17:48] me know in the comments if you think so
[00:17:50] too or I&#39;m missing something I think he
[00:17:52] meant to say that he will he and others
[00:17:54] like him will build incredible defensive
[00:17:57] systems to reduce the effectiveness of
[00:17:59] invading and using offensive systems
[00:18:01] that&#39;s how I&#39;m interpreting I think he
[00:18:03] kind of to me it sounds like he misspoke
[00:18:04] a little bit if if I understand
[00:18:05] correctly because of the way the system
[00:18:07] works I am now a licensed arms deer
[00:18:10] others are building we do that um
[00:18:11] because of the way the system works I am
[00:18:13] now a licensed arms dealer so computer
[00:18:15] scientist businessman arms dealer and
[00:18:19] I&#39;m sorry to agression I I don&#39;t know I
[00:18:21] do not recommend this in your Carew I
[00:18:22] stick with they are um and because of
[00:18:24] the way the laws work um we&#39;re doing
[00:18:25] this privately and then it&#39;s this is all
[00:18:27] legal with the support of the
[00:18:28] governments it goes straight into
[00:18:28] Ukraine and then they fight the war and
[00:18:30] and and without going into all the
[00:18:31] details things are pretty bad I think if
[00:18:33] in May or June if the Russians build up
[00:18:36] as they expecting to Ukraine will lose a
[00:18:38] whole chunk of its territory and will
[00:18:39] begin the process of losing the whole
[00:18:40] country so I believe this was recorded
[00:18:42] in August 2024 just a few days ago or at
[00:18:45] least that&#39;s when it was posted if you
[00:18:47] recall the news headlines about it all
[00:18:49] of them are from like a few hours ago so
[00:18:51] I think he&#39;s talking about 2025 I&#39;m
[00:18:54] assuming so he&#39;s talking about May or
[00:18:55] June of 2025 for most of History humans
[00:18:58] sort of had a mystical understanding of
[00:18:59] the universe and then there&#39;s the
[00:19:00] Scientific Revolution and the
[00:19:01] enlightenment um and in your article you
[00:19:03] argue that now these models are becoming
[00:19:05] so complicated and uh difficult to
[00:19:08] understand that we don&#39;t really know
[00:19:09] what&#39;s going on in them I&#39;ll take a
[00:19:11] quote from Richard fean he says what I
[00:19:12] cannot create I do not understand I saw
[00:19:13] this quote the other day but now people
[00:19:15] are creating things they do not that
[00:19:16] that they can create but they don&#39;t
[00:19:16] really understand what&#39;s inside of them
[00:19:17] is the nature of knowledge changing in a
[00:19:19] way are we gonna have to start just
[00:19:20] taking the word for these models without
[00:19:22] them able being able to explain it to us
[00:19:23] the analogy I would offer is to
[00:19:24] teenagers if you have a teenager you
[00:19:26] know that they&#39;re human but you can&#39;t
[00:19:27] quite figure out what they&#39;re thinking
[00:19:29] um but somehow we&#39;ve managed in society
[00:19:30] to adapt to the presence of teenagers
[00:19:32] right and they eventually grow out of
[00:19:33] that and this serious so it&#39;s probably
[00:19:35] the case we&#39;re going to have knowledge
[00:19:37] systems that we cannot fully
[00:19:38] characterize but we understand their
[00:19:40] boundaries right we understand the
[00:19:42] limits of what they can do and that&#39;s
[00:19:43] probably the best outcome we can get do
[00:19:44] you think we&#39;ll understand the limits we
[00:19:46] we&#39;ll get pretty good at it the
[00:19:47] consensus of my group that meets on
[00:19:49] every week is that eventually the way
[00:19:51] you&#39;ll do this it&#39;s called SOC called
[00:19:52] adversarial AI is that there will there
[00:19:54] will actually be companies that you will
[00:19:56] hire and pay money to to break your AI
[00:19:58] system so it&#39;ll be the r instead of
[00:19:59] human red teams which is what they do
[00:20:00] today you&#39;ll have whole companies and a
[00:20:02] whole industry of AI systems whose jobs
[00:20:04] are to break the existing AI systems and
[00:20:05] find their vulnerabilities especially
[00:20:07] the knowledge that they have that we
[00:20:08] can&#39;t figure out that makes sense to me
[00:20:09] it&#39;s also a great project for you here
[00:20:11] at Stanford because if you have a
[00:20:12] graduate student who has to figure out
[00:20:13] how to attack one of these large models
[00:20:15] and understand what it does that is a
[00:20:16] great skill to build the Next Generation
[00:20:18] so it makes sense to me that the two
[00:20:19] will travel together if that&#39;s something
[00:20:21] that interests you there&#39;s a Twitter SLX
[00:20:23] account Pini The prompter Who uh
[00:20:25] basically jailbreaks a lot of these
[00:20:27] models usually within a few days of
[00:20:28] their release so he&#39;s just of course one
[00:20:30] of uh many people that do sort of things
[00:20:33] like that he does it kind of simly for
[00:20:35] entertainment and for online media
[00:20:38] Clouts but if you think about it third
[00:20:40] party testing third party red teaming of
[00:20:43] AI models third party quality assurance
[00:20:45] right QA of these models as they roll
[00:20:48] out and have contact with consumers with
[00:20:50] businesses with organizations Etc as
[00:20:52] well as just with various infrastructure
[00:20:54] systems and factories automations Etc
[00:20:57] war of course that&#39;s going to be a Big
[00:20:58] Industry that doesn&#39;t really exist yet
[00:21:01] it it just is beginning to grow and yet
[00:21:04] that might be something interesting and
[00:21:06] profitable to get into if that&#39;s uh
[00:21:08] that&#39;s your cup of tea next he comments
[00:21:10] just a bit on adver serial AI you just
[00:21:13] mentioned adversarial I&#39;m wonder if
[00:21:15] elaborate on that more it seems to be
[00:21:16] besides obviously increase get more
[00:21:18] perform mod getting them to do what you
[00:21:20] want
[00:21:22] isue well you have to assume that the
[00:21:24] current hallucination problems become
[00:21:26] less right in as the technology gets
[00:21:28] better and so forth I&#39;m not suggesting
[00:21:29] it goes away and then you also have to
[00:21:31] assume that there are tests for efficacy
[00:21:33] so there has to be a way of knowing that
[00:21:34] the thing succeeded so in the example
[00:21:36] that I gave of the Tik Tok competitor
[00:21:37] and by the way I was not arguing that
[00:21:38] you should illegally steal everybody&#39;s
[00:21:39] music what you would do if you&#39;re a
[00:21:40] silicon value entrepreneur which
[00:21:41] hopefully all of you will be is if it
[00:21:43] took off then you&#39;d hire a whole bunch
[00:21:44] of lawyers to go clean the mess up right
[00:21:45] but if if nobody uses your product it
[00:21:47] doesn&#39;t matter that you stole all the
[00:21:48] content and do not quote me right right
[00:21:51] you&#39;re on camera that&#39;s right but you
[00:21:53] see my point in other words Silicon
[00:21:54] Valley will run these tests and clean up
[00:21:55] the mess and that&#39;s typically how those
[00:21:56] things are done so so my own View is
[00:21:58] that you&#39;ll see more and more um
[00:22:00] performative systems with even better
[00:22:02] test and eventually adversarial tests
[00:22:03] and that&#39;ll keep it within a box the
[00:22:05] technical term is called Chain of
[00:22:06] Thought reasoning and people believe
[00:22:07] that in the next few years you&#39;ll be
[00:22:09] able to generate a thousand steps of
[00:22:10] Chain of Thought reasoning right do this
[00:22:12] do this it&#39;s like building recipes right
[00:22:13] that the recipes you can run the recipe
[00:22:15] and you can actually test that It
[00:22:16] produced the correct outcome and that&#39;s
[00:22:17] how the system will work next they ask
[00:22:19] what&#39;s going to be driving AI progress
[00:22:20] is it more data more compute is it just
[00:22:23] like chips and Hardware the amounts of
[00:22:24] money being thrown around are
[00:22:26] mindboggling and um I&#39;ve chose I
[00:22:29] essentially invest in everything because
[00:22:30] I can&#39;t figure out who&#39;s going to win
[00:22:31] and the amounts of money that are
[00:22:33] following me are so large I think some
[00:22:35] of it is because the early money has
[00:22:36] been made and the big money people who
[00:22:37] don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing have to
[00:22:38] have an AI component and everything is
[00:22:40] now an AI investment so they can&#39;t tell
[00:22:41] the difference I Define ai as Learning
[00:22:43] Systems systems that actually learn so I
[00:22:44] think that&#39;s one of them the second is
[00:22:46] that there are very sophisticated new
[00:22:47] algorithms that are sort of post
[00:22:48] Transformers my friend my collaborator
[00:22:50] for a long time has invented a new non-
[00:22:51] Transformer architecture there&#39;s a group
[00:22:53] that I&#39;m funding in Paris that has
[00:22:54] claims to done the same thing so there&#39;s
[00:22:56] enormous invention there a lot of things
[00:22:57] at Stanford and the final thing is that
[00:22:59] there is a belief in the market that the
[00:23:01] invention of intelligence has infinite
[00:23:03] return so let&#39;s say you have you put $50
[00:23:05] billion of capital into a company you
[00:23:07] have to make an awful lot of money from
[00:23:08] intelligence to pay that back I mean
[00:23:10] when you phrase it like that it seems to
[00:23:11] make sense if you invent intelligence
[00:23:14] certainly that would have an infinite
[00:23:17] return so it&#39;s probably the case that
[00:23:18] we&#39;ll go through some huge investment
[00:23:20] bubble and then it&#39;ll sort itself out
[00:23:21] that&#39;s always been true in the past and
[00:23:23] it&#39;s likely to be true here and what you
[00:23:24] said earlier was you think that the
[00:23:26] leaders are pulling away from right now
[00:23:27] right now and and
[00:23:29] this is a really the question is roughly
[00:23:31] the following there&#39;s a company called
[00:23:32] mrr in France they done a really good
[00:23:34] job um and I&#39;m obviously an investor um
[00:23:36] they have produced their second version
[00:23:38] their third model is likely to be closed
[00:23:39] because it&#39;s so expensive they need
[00:23:41] revenue and they can&#39;t give their model
[00:23:42] away so this open source versus closed
[00:23:44] Source debate in our industry is huge
[00:23:46] and um my entire career was based on
[00:23:49] people being willing to share software
[00:23:50] in open source everything about me is
[00:23:52] open source much of Google&#39;s
[00:23:53] underpinnings were open source
[00:23:54] everything I&#39;ve done technically and yet
[00:23:56] it may be that the capital costs which
[00:23:57] are so immense fundamentally changes how
[00:23:59] software is built you and I were talking
[00:24:01] um my own view of software programmers
[00:24:03] is that software programmers
[00:24:04] productivity will at least double there
[00:24:05] are three or four software companies
[00:24:07] that are trying to do that I&#39;ve invested
[00:24:08] in all of them in and they&#39;re all trying
[00:24:10] to make software programmers more
[00:24:11] productive the most interesting one that
[00:24:12] I just met with is called augment and I
[00:24:14] always think of an individual programmer
[00:24:15] and they said that&#39;s not our Target our
[00:24:16] Target are these 100 person software
[00:24:17] programming teams on millions of lines
[00:24:19] of code where nobody knows what&#39;s going
[00:24:20] on that&#39;s a really good AI thing will
[00:24:22] they make money I hope so you mentioned
[00:24:24] that there&#39;s the combination of the
[00:24:25] context exension the agents and the text
[00:24:27] to action is going to unimaginable
[00:24:29] impacts first of all why is the
[00:24:31] combination important and second of all
[00:24:32] I know that you know you&#39;re not like a
[00:24:33] crystal ball and you can&#39;t necessarily
[00:24:35] tell the future but why do you think
[00:24:36] it&#39;s beyond anything that we could
[00:24:37] imagine I think largely because the
[00:24:38] context window allows you to solve the
[00:24:40] problem of recency the current models
[00:24:42] take a year to train roughly six six
[00:24:44] there 18 months six months of
[00:24:45] preparation six months of training six
[00:24:46] months of fine tuning so they&#39;re always
[00:24:47] out of date context window you can feed
[00:24:50] what happened like you can ask it
[00:24:51] questions about the uh the Hamas Israel
[00:24:53] war right in a context that&#39;s very
[00:24:55] powerful it becomes current like Google
[00:24:56] um in the case of Agents I&#39;ll give you
[00:24:58] an example I set up a foundation which
[00:24:59] is funding a nonprofit which starts
[00:25:01] there&#39;s a I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s
[00:25:02] Chemists in the room that I don&#39;t really
[00:25:03] understand chemistry there&#39;s a a tool
[00:25:05] called chro CW which was an LM based
[00:25:08] system that learned chemistry and what
[00:25:09] they do is they run it to generate
[00:25:10] chemistry hypotheses about proteins and
[00:25:12] they have a lab which runs the tests
[00:25:14] overnight and then it learns that&#39;s a
[00:25:16] huge acceleration accelerant in
[00:25:17] chemistry Material Science and so forth
[00:25:19] so that&#39;s that&#39;s an agent model and I
[00:25:21] think the text to action can be
[00:25:21] understood by just having a lot of sheet
[00:25:23] programmers right um and I don&#39;t think
[00:25:25] we understand what happens and this is
[00:25:26] again your area of expertise what happen
[00:25:28] happens when everyone has their own
[00:25:29] programmer I&#39;m not talking about turning
[00:25:30] on and off the lights you know I imagine
[00:25:32] another example um for some reason you
[00:25:34] don&#39;t like Google so you say build me a
[00:25:35] Google competitor yeah you personally
[00:25:37] you don&#39;t build me a Google competitor
[00:25:38] uh search the web build a UI make a good
[00:25:41] copy um add generative AI in an
[00:25:43] interesting way do it in 30 seconds and
[00:25:45] see if it works right so a lot of people
[00:25:49] believe that the incumbents including
[00:25:50] Google are vulnerable to this kind of an
[00:25:52] attack now we&#39;ll see there were a bunch
[00:25:53] of questions who were sent over by
[00:25:54] slider I want to give some of them
[00:25:55] upload so um here&#39;s one um we talked a
[00:25:57] little about this last year um how can
[00:25:58] we stop AI from influencing public
[00:25:59] opinion misinformation especially during
[00:26:00] the upcoming he&#39;s asked a bit about
[00:26:02] misinformation how can we prevent AI
[00:26:05] from causing misinformation he talks
[00:26:07] about how during his time working with
[00:26:08] YouTube that was a problem people would
[00:26:10] upload a video for profit for their own
[00:26:13] self-gain and as a result of
[00:26:15] misinformation he says well people could
[00:26:17] be hurt he even says people die so
[00:26:19] certainly that is a problem if you saw
[00:26:22] my yesterday&#39;s video about grock 2 and
[00:26:24] the images it generates they&#39;re very re
[00:26:26] looking and grock 2 does not seem to
[00:26:29] have any sort of safety rails in place
[00:26:31] it just generates whatever you ask for
[00:26:33] so heading into the selection certainly
[00:26:35] that could be an issue he talks a little
[00:26:37] bit about some sort of a digital
[00:26:38] authentication or a public key
[00:26:40] authentication basically if somebody
[00:26:42] like the president speaks there&#39;s some
[00:26:44] key that everybody else can verify
[00:26:46] saying okay this is him this is his
[00:26:48] original audio he mentions briefly that
[00:26:50] it&#39;s it seems like he&#39;s saying it&#39;s a
[00:26:51] shame that the American universities
[00:26:53] aren&#39;t getting as much resources for
[00:26:56] computes for Google cloud and other
[00:26:58] places like that and this explosion
[00:27:00] where all the big companies are
[00:27:01] basically gobbling up the available
[00:27:03] resources and so he&#39;s saying the right
[00:27:05] thing for us to do is to get them the
[00:27:07] resources they need to give the
[00:27:08] universities the compute the resources
[00:27:10] that they need to pursue research and
[00:27:12] development and all that stuff next they
[00:27:13] talk about automation who&#39;s getting
[00:27:15] replaced who&#39;s getting to be obsolete in
[00:27:18] the labor force so let&#39;s take a look at
[00:27:20] that really fast I&#39;ll defer to the real
[00:27:22] expert here uh as your amateur Economist
[00:27:24] taught by Eric um I I fundamentally
[00:27:27] believe that the the sort of college
[00:27:28] education High skills task will be fine
[00:27:30] because people will work with these
[00:27:31] systems I think the systems is no
[00:27:33] different from any other technology wave
[00:27:34] the dangerous jobs and the jobs which
[00:27:35] require very little human judgment will
[00:27:37] get replaced the next question is kind
[00:27:39] of like the global balance of AI power
[00:27:42] so the person asking the question
[00:27:43] specifically mentions us and China but
[00:27:46] as you see here Eric specifically
[00:27:48] focuses on India take a listen the most
[00:27:50] interesting country is India because the
[00:27:52] top AI people come from India to the us
[00:27:54] and we should let India keep some of its
[00:27:56] top talent not all of them but some of
[00:27:57] them um and they don&#39;t have the kind of
[00:27:58] training facilities and programs that we
[00:28:00] so richly have here to me India is the
[00:28:01] big swing state in that regard China&#39;s
[00:28:03] Lost it&#39;s not going to not going to come
[00:28:04] back they&#39;re not going to change the
[00:28:05] regime as much as people wish them to do
[00:28:07] Japan and Korea are clearly in our camp
[00:28:09] Taiwan is a fantastic country whose
[00:28:11] software is terrible so that&#39;s not gonna
[00:28:12] going to work um amazing hard and in the
[00:28:15] rest of the world there are not a lot of
[00:28:16] other good choices that are big German
[00:28:18] the Europe is screwed up because of
[00:28:19] Brussels it&#39;s not a new fact I spent 10
[00:28:20] years fighting them and I work really
[00:28:22] hard to get them to fix the the EU act
[00:28:24] and they still have all the restrictions
[00:28:26] that make it very difficult to do our
[00:28:27] kind of research in Europe my French
[00:28:28] friends have spent all their time
[00:28:29] battling Brussels and mcon who&#39;s a
[00:28:31] personal friend is fighting hard for
[00:28:33] this and so France I think has a chance
[00:28:34] I don&#39;t see I don&#39;t see Germany coming
[00:28:35] and the rest is not big
[00:28:36] enough yes ma&#39;am so I know you&#39;re an
[00:28:39] engineer by
[00:28:40] trainer um given the capabilities that
[00:28:43] you Enis these mod should we still spend
[00:28:44] Hing to yeah because because ultimately
[00:28:46] it&#39;s it&#39;s the old thing of why do you
[00:28:47] study English if you can speak English
[00:28:49] you get better at it right you really do
[00:28:50] need to understand how these systems
[00:28:51] work and I feel very strong yes sir yeah
[00:28:53] I&#39;m curious if you explore good answer
[00:28:55] distributed setting and I&#39;m asking
[00:28:56] because sure like making a large cluster
[00:28:58] but Ma are powerful there&#39;s a lot of
[00:28:59] small maches across the world so like
[00:29:01] you think like folding at home are a
[00:29:02] similar idea works for training yeah we
[00:29:04] look very hard this so the way the
[00:29:06] algorithms work is you have a very large
[00:29:07] Matrix and you have essentially a
[00:29:08] multiplication function so think of it
[00:29:10] as going back and forth and back and
[00:29:12] forth and these systems are completely
[00:29:13] limited by the speed of memory to CPU or
[00:29:15] GPU and in fact the next iteration of
[00:29:18] Nvidia chips has combined all those
[00:29:20] functions into one chip the chips are
[00:29:21] now so big that they glue them all
[00:29:22] together and in fact the package is so
[00:29:24] sensitive the package is put together in
[00:29:26] a clean room as well as the chip itself
[00:29:27] so the looks like supercomputers and
[00:29:29] speed of light especially memory
[00:29:31] interconnect really dominated so I think
[00:29:32] unlikely for a while is there a way to
[00:29:33] segment the element like so Jeff de last
[00:29:35] year when he spoke here talked about
[00:29:36] having these different parts of it you
[00:29:38] train separately and then kind of
[00:29:39] Federate them each you know in order to
[00:29:41] do that you&#39;d have to have 10 million
[00:29:42] such things and then you&#39;re the way you
[00:29:44] ask the questions would be too slow he&#39;s
[00:29:45] talking about eight or 10 12 not at Lev
[00:29:49] the back way back I know like after
[00:29:51] releas new yor time open using work for
[00:29:53] training do you think
[00:29:54] that&#39;s I used to do a lot of work on the
[00:29:56] music licensing stuff what I learned was
[00:29:58] that in the 60s there was a series of
[00:30:00] lawsuits that resulted in an agreement
[00:30:02] where you get a a stipulated royalty
[00:30:04] whenever your song is played even even
[00:30:06] they don&#39;t even know who you are so paid
[00:30:07] into a bank and my guess is it&#39;ll be the
[00:30:08] same thing there be lots of lawsuits and
[00:30:09] there&#39;ll be some kind of stipulated
[00:30:10] agreement which will just say you have
[00:30:12] to pay x per of whatever Revenue you
[00:30:14] have in order to use pass cap BMI cap
[00:30:16] BMI look them up it&#39;s long it will seem
[00:30:17] very old to you but I think that&#39;s how
[00:30:18] it will yes sir interesting like there&#39;s
[00:30:21] a few players that are dominating AI
[00:30:23] right they&#39;ll continue to dominate and
[00:30:24] they seem to overlap with the large
[00:30:25] companies that all the antitrust
[00:30:27] regulation is kind of focus on how do
[00:30:28] you see those two Trends kind of yeah
[00:30:30] like do you see Regulators breaking up
[00:30:31] these companies and how will that affect
[00:30:33] the yeah so in my career I helped
[00:30:36] Microsoft get broken up and it wasn&#39;t
[00:30:37] broken up and I fought fought for Google
[00:30:39] to not be broken up and it&#39;s not been
[00:30:40] broken up so it sure looks to me like
[00:30:41] the trend is not to be broken up um as
[00:30:43] long as the companies avoid being John D
[00:30:45] Rockefeller the senior and I studied
[00:30:46] this looked it up it&#39;s how antitrust law
[00:30:48] came I don&#39;t think the government is
[00:30:49] will act the re the reason you&#39;re seeing
[00:30:51] these large companies dominate is who
[00:30:52] has the capital to build these data
[00:30:54] centers right right so my friend Reed
[00:30:56] and my friend com
[00:30:58] two have we talked to you about the
[00:31:00] decision that they made to take
[00:31:01] inflection so I believe Mustafa he&#39;s
[00:31:02] talking about Mustafa siman who is the
[00:31:04] co-founder of Google Deep Mind friend
[00:31:06] Reed and my friend M coming next we two
[00:31:08] week have Reed talked to you about the
[00:31:10] decision that they made to take
[00:31:11] inflection and essentially PE part it
[00:31:12] into Microsoft basically they decided
[00:31:14] they couldn&#39;t raise the tens of billions
[00:31:15] of dollars is that number public that
[00:31:16] you mentioned earlier have
[00:31:18] have
[00:31:20] got we want
[00:31:24] this I was wondering where all this is
[00:31:26] going to leave countries where in b
[00:31:27] ipants in phun models and access to
[00:31:30] compu the rich get richer and the poor
[00:31:32] do the best they can um they&#39;ll have to
[00:31:34] the fact of the matter is this is a rich
[00:31:36] country&#39;s game right huge Capital lots
[00:31:38] of technically strong people strong
[00:31:39] government support right there are two
[00:31:41] examples there lots of other countries
[00:31:43] that have all sorts of problems they
[00:31:43] don&#39;t have those resources they&#39;ll have
[00:31:44] to find a partner they&#39;ll have to join
[00:31:46] with somebody else something like that I
[00:31:48] last we met you he&#39;s fairly blunt he&#39;s
[00:31:50] fairly straightforward he I think kind
[00:31:52] of calls it how he sees it and it really
[00:31:55] seems like he&#39;s not talking one side or
[00:31:56] the other he doesn&#39;t have he&#39;s not
[00:31:58] pumping his back so to speak so he&#39;s not
[00:32:00] saying the things that benefit his
[00:32:01] portfolio or whatever he&#39;s just like
[00:32:03] yeah this is how it&#39;s going to be this
[00:32:04] is how it works by default big companies
[00:32:06] are not going to broken up the rich get
[00:32:07] richer Etc and finally he&#39;s asked a
[00:32:10] little bit more about kind of the
[00:32:11] business and entrepreneur side of things
[00:32:13] if you&#39;re starting your own company you
[00:32:15] have a product idea what does that look
[00:32:16] like how do you develop it how do you
[00:32:18] create a lot of wealth with your own
[00:32:20] product here&#39;s his answer I want I think
[00:32:23] the last we met you you at hackathon at
[00:32:24] AGI house and I know you spent a lot of
[00:32:26] time helping like young people as they
[00:32:27] create a lot of wealth and you spoke
[00:32:28] very passionately about about wanting to
[00:32:30] to do that do you have any advice for
[00:32:31] folks here as they&#39;re building their
[00:32:32] they&#39;re writing their business PL for
[00:32:33] this class or policy proposals or
[00:32:34] research proposals um you know at this
[00:32:36] stage of the careers going forward well
[00:32:39] um I teach a class in the business
[00:32:40] school on this so you should come to my
[00:32:41] class um the I am struck by the speed
[00:32:44] which with which you can build
[00:32:46] demonstrations of new ideas so in that
[00:32:49] in one of the hack I did the winning
[00:32:51] team the command was fly the Drone
[00:32:53] between two towers and it was given a
[00:32:54] virtual drone space and it figured out
[00:32:56] how to fly the Drone what the word
[00:32:57] between them generated the code in
[00:32:58] Python and flew the Drone in the
[00:32:59] simulator through the tower I just it
[00:33:01] would have taken a week or two you know
[00:33:03] good professional programmers to do that
[00:33:05] um I&#39;m telling you that the ability to
[00:33:06] prototype quickly really you know part
[00:33:08] part of the problem being an
[00:33:09] entrepreneur is everything happens
[00:33:10] faster well now if you can&#39;t get your
[00:33:12] prototype built in a day using these
[00:33:14] various tools you need to think about
[00:33:16] that right because that&#39;s who your
[00:33:17] competitor is doing so I guess my
[00:33:18] biggest advice is when you start
[00:33:19] thinking about a company is find the
[00:33:20] right a business CL plan in fact you
[00:33:22] should ask the computer to write your
[00:33:23] business plan for you
[00:33:25] um talk about that after leave it and
[00:33:28] and but I think it&#39;s very important to
[00:33:30] prototype your idea using these tools as
[00:33:32] quickly as you can because you can be
[00:33:33] sure there&#39;s another person doing
[00:33:34] exactly that same thing in another
[00:33:36] company in another University in a place
[00:33:38] that You&#39; all right
[00:33:40] thank very cool so this piece was uh
[00:33:43] taken down so apparently it&#39;s not even
[00:33:44] online right now but hopefully those few
[00:33:47] little Clips give you glips about what
[00:33:49] he thinks of AI you know I&#39;ve kind of
[00:33:51] cut out all the pieces that I think
[00:33:53] caused the controversy or whatever that
[00:33:55] situation was I don&#39;t think it really
[00:33:56] had anything to do with AI or anything
[00:33:58] of of substance I mean maybe touched on
[00:34:01] some political issues but whatever this
[00:34:03] is a person with a lot of really
[00:34:05] technical background and even though
[00:34:07] he&#39;s more of like a business guy he is
[00:34:10] spoken of with a lot of respect by all
[00:34:12] the engineers and all the very highly
[00:34:14] technical people in the Bay Area in the
[00:34:16] Silicon Valley he&#39;s somebody that really
[00:34:17] understands the tech space looks like
[00:34:19] Forbes has him listed as having a netw
[00:34:21] worth of almost $24 billion he&#39;s good
[00:34:25] friends he said with Sam Alman president
[00:34:27] of France France sounds like he knows
[00:34:29] all the co-founders of various AI
[00:34:31] companies big and small I mean this is
[00:34:33] somebody that&#39;s very very on the inside
[00:34:35] this is somebody that knows where things
[00:34:37] are going so certainly when he says
[00:34:39] something I tend to listen I put a great
[00:34:41] deal of weight into what he&#39;s saying and
[00:34:43] what he&#39;s saying is this AI wave is just
[00:34:47] starting we have two massive countries
[00:34:49] two big countries with the capital and
[00:34:50] the talent and everything else that&#39;s
[00:34:52] needed that are vying for AI Supremacy
[00:34:54] the issues with the chips and the power
[00:34:56] and the data while those are bottlenecks
[00:34:59] it seems like they will slowly be
[00:35:01] perhaps even maybe not that slowly
[00:35:03] slowly but but be improved you mentioned
[00:35:05] building data centers and various other
[00:35:07] AI infrastructure in Canada potentially
[00:35:10] which makes a lot of sense if you think
[00:35:12] about it lots of open land tends to be
[00:35:14] colder which again you know Heating and
[00:35:17] the generation of heat and having to
[00:35:19] cool these facilities is a concern tons
[00:35:22] land very friendly government to the US
[00:35:24] you know in factorio how do you just
[00:35:26] like find a big chunk of the map where
[00:35:28] there&#39;s a lot of open land and you&#39;d
[00:35:30] build all your nuclear power plants
[00:35:32] you&#39;d build out your entire like
[00:35:34] electricity infrastructure there just
[00:35:36] have a cable going back to where you
[00:35:38] need electricity to be it begs the
[00:35:40] question is this the future of Canada
[00:35:42] I&#39;m only kidding of course folks but the
[00:35:45] more and more I think about it there is
[00:35:46] a lot of land it&#39;s close by and it&#39;s
[00:35:49] cold and certainly that would be
[00:35:51] phenomenal for the revenue of Canada to
[00:35:53] generate some sort of tax some sort of
[00:35:55] Revenue based on right one of the kind
[00:35:57] of superpowers building out the
[00:35:59] infrastructure it needs to stay dominant
[00:36:01] in the AI race right I mean they&#39;re
[00:36:03] talking about creating 100 billion doll
[00:36:06] data centers potentially even the
[00:36:08] estimates a size 300 billion so that&#39;s
[00:36:10] that&#39;s one company that&#39;s not even the
[00:36:12] US government supported projects that&#39;s
[00:36:15] just a publicly traded company doing
[00:36:17] that sounds like he&#39;s really believing
[00:36:19] in Nvidia and the power of Nvidia and
[00:36:21] it&#39;s Cuda sort of software that the
[00:36:24] chips run on and if I&#39;m understanding
[00:36:26] him correctly he&#39;s not really seeing any
[00:36:28] competition to that I mean there&#39;s some
[00:36:30] things in the Horizon maybe possibly but
[00:36:32] nothing yet so it sounds like a lot of
[00:36:35] this money like a lot of it will be
[00:36:36] flowing into Nvidia and of course this
[00:36:39] idea that as the context window expands
[00:36:41] it&#39;ll become more and more sort of
[00:36:44] similar to training in a sense that
[00:36:46] right if it takes a while to train up a
[00:36:47] model but it can do in context learning
[00:36:50] meaning that you&#39;re able to just upload
[00:36:51] books and stuff to the finished model
[00:36:53] it&#39;s able to learn from them which we&#39;ve
[00:36:54] seen that with Gemini they found a
[00:36:56] language that doesn&#39;t have an a lot of
[00:36:57] online presence only something like 24
[00:37:00] people in the world speak it but they
[00:37:01] have some notebooks and manuscripts and
[00:37:03] stuff like that they uploaded to gini
[00:37:05] the actual finished trained Gemini and
[00:37:08] that model was able to learn how to
[00:37:11] speak it how to create sentences in it
[00:37:13] it wasn&#39;t trained on it it would learned
[00:37:15] in context right so as the context
[00:37:18] window ramps up to 10 million tokens
[00:37:21] that certainly seems like it would
[00:37:22] change how we think about pre- and
[00:37:25] posttraining or in other words once the
[00:37:27] model is trained it doesn&#39;t stop
[00:37:29] learning if you wanted to learn about a
[00:37:31] specific thing that you wanted to learn
[00:37:33] about maybe it&#39;s you know you have a
[00:37:34] company or that that have millions of
[00:37:37] documents and procedures and stuff like
[00:37:39] that just kind of like everywhere but no
[00:37:41] one person understands all of it well in
[00:37:43] the past that was kind of useless it
[00:37:45] doesn&#39;t really help you but if you can
[00:37:47] upload it to a model like that all of a
[00:37:49] sudden it knows all those things about
[00:37:51] your company it can train people on it
[00:37:54] it can answer your questions it can kind
[00:37:55] of manage it update see if there&#39;s any
[00:37:58] conflicts anywhere in it so instead of
[00:38:00] training a brand new model on that you
[00:38:02] just use an existing model and upload
[00:38:04] that stuff into the 10 million token
[00:38:07] context window combine that with text to
[00:38:09] action which is another word I&#39;ve heard
[00:38:11] it before this phrase but it&#39;s not that
[00:38:14] often used I feel like but yeah I mean
[00:38:16] that&#39;s what agents are basically right
[00:38:18] it&#39;s text to action you type in impr
[00:38:21] prompt and it goes and does that action
[00:38:23] it does the thing you&#39;re asking it to do
[00:38:25] as they get better at long-term plan
[00:38:27] long-term reasoning and actually Deep
[00:38:29] Mind CEO de saabi is also just had an
[00:38:32] interview talking about something very
[00:38:34] very similar he&#39;s talking about this
[00:38:36] idea that as agents become better
[00:38:38] long-term reasoners and planners they
[00:38:40] will become better and better at
[00:38:42] carrying out those long Horizon tasks
[00:38:44] and he&#39;s saying we&#39;re not ready for it
[00:38:46] when everybody can have these qualified
[00:38:49] capable agents right he&#39;s saying it&#39;s
[00:38:51] going to have an impact on the world at
[00:38:53] a scale no one understands yet and that
[00:38:56] certainly I think is true that&#39;s
[00:38:58] certainly something that I fully agree
[00:39:00] with a lot of our social structures and
[00:39:03] stuff we&#39;re kind of used to will have to
[00:39:05] change and of course he&#39;s saying if
[00:39:06] you&#39;re worried about losing your job
[00:39:08] having a degree that&#39;s going to become
[00:39:09] worthless you know should you still
[00:39:11] learn to code he&#39;s saying business as
[00:39:13] usual there yes some easy simple jobs or
[00:39:16] maybe very dangerous jobs jobs where
[00:39:18] there&#39;s not a lot of hard decisions to
[00:39:20] be made yes those might go away and yes
[00:39:23] these AIS might be pretty good at coding
[00:39:25] creating projects but learning all those
[00:39:27] skills getting better at those skills
[00:39:28] learning how everything works that&#39;s
[00:39:30] that&#39;s not going out of fashion that&#39;s
[00:39:32] never going to just disappear his
[00:39:34] example was you know if you can speak
[00:39:36] English why would you learn English
[00:39:38] right why would you study English well
[00:39:40] it&#39;s to get better at it to improve your
[00:39:42] abilities with it so I hope you enjoyed
[00:39:44] that make sure you subscribed please
[00:39:46] give me a thumbs up if you enjoyed it my
[00:39:48] name is Wes rth and I&#39;ll see you next
[00:39:49] time thank you for watching
[00:00:00] Eric Schmidt gave a facety talk at
[00:00:02] Stanford just a few days ago about AI he
[00:00:05] was of course the former Google CEO and
[00:00:08] perceived by people as a bit of a
[00:00:10] futurist he&#39;s able to kind of often very
[00:00:12] accurately predict where technology is
[00:00:14] going the interview was over an hour
[00:00:16] long and it was fascinating covering
[00:00:18] topics like ai ai agents where this
[00:00:20] whole thing is going Etc and had a lot
[00:00:22] of pretty brilliant insights by Eric
[00:00:25] into where he believes this is going but
[00:00:28] unfortunately at our plus long interview
[00:00:30] there was just one comment that people
[00:00:32] didn&#39;t like the media machine went into
[00:00:35] overdrive mode and the video has been
[00:00:38] basically taken down it&#39;s no longer
[00:00:40] available to see it was deemed too hot
[00:00:43] for the internet and no longer available
[00:00:45] but just between you and me and keep
[00:00:48] this on the DL please I might have a
[00:00:51] copy of it maybe allegedly I feel like I
[00:00:54] need to say something here that reduces
[00:00:55] my liability some sort of a legal
[00:00:58] statement like I take no resp
[00:00:59] responsibility for my actions yeah that
[00:01:01] should do subscribe for more sweet AI
[00:01:03] content let&#39;s take a look at a few clips
[00:01:05] from this Stanford lecture by Eric
[00:01:08] Schmidt about AI I think you will like
[00:01:10] it if you do hit that thumbs up please
[00:01:13] because this is somebody that has a bit
[00:01:14] of a Clairvoyance about the future of
[00:01:16] tech he tends to see how things will
[00:01:18] unfold with startling accuracy so before
[00:01:21] he starts talking he asks the class to
[00:01:23] basically Define what a context window
[00:01:25] is and what AI agents are context
[00:01:28] Windows of course you can think of it as
[00:01:29] sort of a short-term memory it&#39;s
[00:01:31] basically the amount of words that a
[00:01:33] large language model can read and also
[00:01:36] write and output and kind of interact
[00:01:38] with right so if it has a large context
[00:01:40] window you can give it a whole book and
[00:01:42] then ask it questions about the book if
[00:01:44] it has a very short context window we
[00:01:46] might start answering a question and
[00:01:47] then halfway through forget what I was
[00:01:49] talking about it would be kind of a
[00:01:50] whoops I run out of memory type of thing
[00:01:52] and AI agents are things they can sort
[00:01:55] of complete tasks on your behalf you can
[00:01:56] tell them to go order something off of
[00:01:58] Amazon they&#39;ll go they&#39;ll search they&#39;ll
[00:02:00] do reviews they&#39;ll check the sizes the
[00:02:02] colors whatever and then order it and
[00:02:04] then report that they&#39;ve done it back to
[00:02:05] you so you can think of it as kind of a
[00:02:07] smart intern that&#39;s online that&#39;s Ai and
[00:02:10] Eric is talking about potentially a
[00:02:11] seeing a 10 million token context window
[00:02:15] sometime soon potentially in next two
[00:02:17] years or so he doesn&#39;t specify a
[00:02:19] timeline but soon so the first thing he
[00:02:21] talks about is what are we going to
[00:02:23] expect to happen in the next 2 to 5
[00:02:26] years so in the short term specifically
[00:02:29] at the intersection of something like a
[00:02:31] 10 million token context window and
[00:02:33] improving autonomous AI agents take a
[00:02:35] listen so an agent is something that
[00:02:37] does that does some kind of a task
[00:02:39] another definition would be that it&#39;s an
[00:02:40] LM State and memory okay can anybody
[00:02:44] again scientist can can any of you
[00:02:45] define text action taking text and
[00:02:47] turning into an action right here go
[00:02:48] ahead yes instead of taking text and
[00:02:50] turning it into more text more text
[00:02:52] taking text and have the AI trigger
[00:02:54] actions based so another definition
[00:02:56] would be language to python a pro
[00:02:59] programming language I never wanted to
[00:03:00] see survive and and everything in AI is
[00:03:02] being done in Python there&#39;s a new
[00:03:03] language called Mojo that has just come
[00:03:05] out which looks like they finally have
[00:03:06] addressed AI programming but we&#39;ll see
[00:03:07] if that actually survives over the
[00:03:08] dominance of python um one more
[00:03:10] technical question why is NVIDIA worth2
[00:03:12] trillion doll and the other companies
[00:03:14] are struggling technical answer I mean I
[00:03:16] think it just boils down to like most of
[00:03:17] code needs to run with C optimizations
[00:03:19] that currently only support so other
[00:03:21] companies can make whatever they want to
[00:03:22] but unless they have the 10 years of
[00:03:24] software there you don&#39;t have the
[00:03:25] machine learning optimization I like to
[00:03:27] think of Cuda as the C programming
[00:03:29] language for
[00:03:30] yeah right that&#39;s the way I like to
[00:03:31] think of it was founded in 2008 I always
[00:03:32] thought it was a terrible language and
[00:03:34] yet it&#39;s become dominant there&#39;s another
[00:03:35] Insight there&#39;s a set of Open Source
[00:03:36] libraries which are highly optimized to
[00:03:38] Cuda and not anything else and everybody
[00:03:39] who builds all these Stacks right this
[00:03:41] is completely missed in any of the
[00:03:42] discussions right the com it&#39;s
[00:03:44] technically called VM and a whole bunch
[00:03:45] of libraries like that highly optimized
[00:03:47] Cuda very hard to replicate that if
[00:03:48] you&#39;re a competitor so what does all
[00:03:50] this mean in the next year you&#39;re going
[00:03:52] to see very large context Windows agents
[00:03:56] and text action when they are delivered
[00:03:58] at scale it&#39;s going to have an impact on
[00:03:59] world at a scale that no one understands
[00:04:01] yet much bigger than the horrific impact
[00:04:03] we&#39;ve had on by social media right in my
[00:04:05] view so here&#39;s why in a context window
[00:04:07] you can basically use that as short-term
[00:04:08] memory and I was shocked that context
[00:04:11] Windows get this long the technical
[00:04:12] reasons have to do with the fact that
[00:04:13] it&#39;s hard to serve hard to calculate and
[00:04:14] so forth the interesting thing about
[00:04:15] short-term memory when you feed the you
[00:04:18] ask a question read 20 books you give it
[00:04:20] the text of the books is the query and
[00:04:22] you say tell me what they say it forgets
[00:04:23] the middle which is exactly how human
[00:04:25] brains work too right that&#39;s where we
[00:04:26] are with respect to agents there are
[00:04:28] people who are now building essentially
[00:04:30] llm agents and the way they do it is
[00:04:31] they read something like chemistry they
[00:04:33] discover the principles of chemistry and
[00:04:34] then they test it and then they add that
[00:04:36] back into their understanding right
[00:04:38] that&#39;s extremely powerful and then the
[00:04:40] third thing as I mentioned is text
[00:04:41] action so I&#39;ll give you an example the
[00:04:43] government is in the process of trying
[00:04:45] to ban Tik to we&#39;ll see if that actually
[00:04:46] happens if Tik Tok is banned here&#39;s what
[00:04:48] I propose each and every one of you do
[00:04:49] say to your L the foll make me a copy of
[00:04:53] Tik Tok steal all the users steal all
[00:04:55] the music put my preferences in it
[00:04:57] produce this program in the next 30
[00:04:59] seconds release it and in one hour if
[00:05:01] it&#39;s not viral do something different
[00:05:03] along the same lines that&#39;s the command
[00:05:05] boom boom boom boom right you understand
[00:05:08] how powerful that is if you could go
[00:05:09] from arbitrary language to arbitrary
[00:05:11] digital command which is essentially
[00:05:12] what python in this scenario is imagine
[00:05:14] that each and every human on the planet
[00:05:16] has their own programmer that actually
[00:05:18] does what they want as opposed to the
[00:05:18] programmers that work for me who don&#39;t
[00:05:20] do what I ask or potentially a whole
[00:05:22] Army of AI influencers each with its own
[00:05:25] little tweak that are completely managed
[00:05:28] by these AI agents trying to fill a
[00:05:30] certain Niche a certain Gap a certain
[00:05:32] personality type you can have an
[00:05:34] infinite amount of them boasting 24
[00:05:36] hours a day the programmers here know
[00:05:38] what I&#39;m talking about so imagine a non-
[00:05:39] arrogant programmer that actually does
[00:05:41] what you want and you don&#39;t have to pay
[00:05:42] all that money to and there&#39;s infinite
[00:05:44] supply of these program this is all
[00:05:45] within the next year or two very soon
[00:05:47] those three things and I&#39;m quite
[00:05:49] convinced it&#39;s the union of those three
[00:05:50] things that will happen in the next wave
[00:05:53] so you asked about what else is going to
[00:05:54] happen um every six months I oscillate
[00:05:57] so we&#39;re on a it&#39;s an even odd
[00:05:58] oscillation the moment the gap between
[00:06:01] the frontier models which they&#39;re now
[00:06:02] only three I&#39;ll ref few who they are and
[00:06:05] everybody else appears to me to be
[00:06:06] getting larger six months ago I was
[00:06:08] convinced that the Gap was getting
[00:06:09] smaller so I invested lots of money in
[00:06:10] the little companies now I&#39;m not so sure
[00:06:13] and I&#39;m talking to the big companies and
[00:06:14] the big companies are telling me that
[00:06:15] they need 10 billion 20 billion 50
[00:06:18] billion 100 billion is 100 billion right
[00:06:21] they very very hard I talked Sam
[00:06:23] Stargate is Microsoft and open AI sort
[00:06:26] of co- project where they plan to invest
[00:06:28] a 100 billion into a Data Center and by
[00:06:31] the way that&#39;s not the only project
[00:06:33] where they&#39;re kind of working together
[00:06:34] the other one is the power plant the
[00:06:37] fusion power plant somewhere near
[00:06:39] Seattle Washington in that area that
[00:06:42] they hope could potentially provide a
[00:06:43] lot of you know maybe not unlimited
[00:06:45] energy but clean cheap inexpensive
[00:06:48] energy to power a lot of the stuff next
[00:06:50] he&#39;s talking about what he and Sam Alpin
[00:06:52] talked about Sam Alman is a close friend
[00:06:54] he believes it&#39;s going to take about 300
[00:06:56] billion maybe more I pointed out to him
[00:06:58] that I done the calculation on the
[00:06:59] amount of energy required and I and I
[00:07:02] then in the spirit of full disclosure
[00:07:03] went to the White House on Friday and
[00:07:04] told them that we need to become best
[00:07:06] friends with Canada because Canada has
[00:07:08] really nice people helped invent Ai and
[00:07:10] lots of hydrop power because we as a
[00:07:12] country do not have enough power to do
[00:07:13] this keep in mind too that there&#39;s a lot
[00:07:15] of sort of heat generated in these
[00:07:17] processes so the need to cool these
[00:07:20] buildings these infrastructures you know
[00:07:23] if you&#39;re running it somewhere where
[00:07:24] it&#39;s hot you also have to consider your
[00:07:26] AC Bill running it somewhere where it&#39;s
[00:07:28] naturally cold old could be very you
[00:07:31] know profitable you would greatly slash
[00:07:33] your costs because you don&#39;t have to
[00:07:34] worry about cooling or at least not as
[00:07:37] much the alternative is to have the
[00:07:39] Arabs fund it and I like the Arabs
[00:07:40] personally I spent lots of time there
[00:07:42] right but they&#39;re not going to adhere to
[00:07:43] our national security rules whereas
[00:07:44] Canada and the US are part of a trit
[00:07:46] where that we all so the1 billion $300
[00:07:48] billion data centers electricity starts
[00:07:49] becoming the scarce resource well but
[00:07:51] and by the way if you follow this line
[00:07:52] of reasoning why did I discuss Cuda and
[00:07:54] Nvidia if $300 billion is all going to
[00:07:56] go to Nvidia you know what to do in the
[00:07:57] stock market okay that&#39;s sounds like
[00:07:59] he&#39;s recommending people buy Nvidia not
[00:08:01] a stock recommendation I&#39;m not a
[00:08:03] licens well part of it so we&#39;re need a
[00:08:05] lot more chips but Intel is getting a
[00:08:07] lot of money from the US government
[00:08:08] AMD they&#39;re trying to build you know
[00:08:10] Fabs raise your hand if you have an
[00:08:12] Intel computer in your Intel chip in any
[00:08:14] of your Computing
[00:08:15] devices okay so much for the Monopoly
[00:08:19] well that that&#39;s that&#39;s the point though
[00:08:20] they once did have a monopoly absolutely
[00:08:21] and Nvidia has a monopoly now so are
[00:08:22] those barriers T like like Cuda is that
[00:08:24] is there something that other so I was
[00:08:26] talking to Percy Percy land the other
[00:08:27] day he&#39;s switching between tpus and
[00:08:29] Nvidia depending on what you can get
[00:08:30] access so for those who are not aware
[00:08:32] one big race that&#39;s happening right now
[00:08:34] is kind of the race to produce these
[00:08:37] chips that power AI growth and Nvidia
[00:08:40] has been kind of the I mean you can say
[00:08:41] the Undisputed leader in the field
[00:08:43] producing gpus graphical processing
[00:08:46] units and those have been very effective
[00:08:48] they kind of started with you know
[00:08:50] computer games acceleration because
[00:08:51] instead of running each process kind of
[00:08:53] independently finishing and running the
[00:08:55] next one which could create bottlenecks
[00:08:57] it runs them in parallel so for example
[00:08:59] if you&#39;re rendering and gain them on
[00:09:00] screen right you have some some crazy 3D
[00:09:03] game with solar rays and whatever that&#39;s
[00:09:05] running in you know 30 frames per second
[00:09:07] 60 frames per second you know what I
[00:09:08] mean you need to be able to Rend each
[00:09:10] pixel on the screen in real time you
[00:09:12] can&#39;t wait for it to get rendered you
[00:09:14] have to kind of render it all in
[00:09:16] parallel and gpus were really good at
[00:09:18] that that&#39;s part of the power of why
[00:09:20] Nvidia is so powerful as well as Cuda
[00:09:22] the programming language that they run
[00:09:24] on but we do have other alternatives for
[00:09:26] these AI chips the TPU the tensor
[00:09:29] processing unit is Google&#39;s creation
[00:09:31] recently we&#39;ve also seen Gro which is a
[00:09:34] something that they refer to as a
[00:09:35] language processing unit and lpu there&#39;s
[00:09:38] been some talk of neuromorphic chips
[00:09:41] which are more designed like the human
[00:09:42] brain they&#39;re not digital they&#39;re more
[00:09:44] analog but I don&#39;t know if any progress
[00:09:46] has been made in that field and it
[00:09:48] sounds like Sam Alman is cooking up a
[00:09:51] brand new chip that might eventually go
[00:09:53] on to compete with Nvidia that&#39;s still
[00:09:55] in the very early stages but that&#39;s the
[00:09:57] big question is NVIDIA continue to
[00:10:00] dominate or is somebody going to come
[00:10:01] out with something that&#39;s brand new and
[00:10:03] much much better for AI specifically cuz
[00:10:06] gpus aren&#39;t necessarily the best
[00:10:10] possible sort of architecture for AI
[00:10:14] they happen to be very good they happen
[00:10:15] to be the best thing we have right now
[00:10:17] but nothing&#39;s to say that some different
[00:10:19] architecture can&#39;t be a million times
[00:10:22] better just because it&#39;s built from
[00:10:23] scratch for AI inference and training
[00:10:26] absolutely and Nvidia has a monopoly now
[00:10:28] so are those barriers like like Cuda is
[00:10:30] that is there something that other so I
[00:10:32] was talking to Percy Percy the other day
[00:10:33] he&#39;s switching between tpus and Nvidia
[00:10:35] chips depending on what he can get
[00:10:36] access to because he doesn&#39;t have a
[00:10:38] choice if he had infinite money he would
[00:10:39] today he would pick the b200
[00:10:41] architecture out of Nvidia because it
[00:10:42] would be faster and I&#39;m not suggest I
[00:10:44] mean it&#39;s great to have competition i&#39;
[00:10:45] AMD and Lisa Su at create length they
[00:10:47] have built a a thing which will
[00:10:48] translate from um this Cuda architecture
[00:10:50] that you were describing to their own
[00:10:52] which is called rock it doesn&#39;t quite
[00:10:53] work yet they&#39;re working on it so Lisa
[00:10:55] Sue that&#39;s of AMD so one of the Nidia
[00:10:59] competitors AMD and Lisa Su great length
[00:11:01] they have built a a thing which will
[00:11:03] translate from um this Cuda architecture
[00:11:05] that you were describing to their own
[00:11:06] which is called roam it doesn&#39;t quite
[00:11:07] work yet that get transcribed as cud
[00:11:10] architecture but that&#39;s not what it is
[00:11:12] he&#39;s saying Cuda architecture cud da so
[00:11:14] the Nidia sort of architecture versus
[00:11:16] Rockham I&#39;m not familiar with that one I
[00:11:18] guess that&#39;s amd&#39;s version of Cuda U you
[00:11:21] were at Google for a long time and uh
[00:11:23] they invented the Transformer
[00:11:24] architecture it&#39;s all Peter&#39;s fault
[00:11:26] thanks to uh to brilliant people over
[00:11:27] there like Peter and Jeff and everyone
[00:11:29] um but now it doesn&#39;t seem like they&#39;re
[00:11:32] they kind of lost ini so I guess this is
[00:11:34] the part that caused all the hubub I&#39;m
[00:11:35] just skipping it I&#39;m not touching it
[00:11:37] it&#39;s not really related to AI
[00:11:39] necessarily unfortunately I think
[00:11:41] there&#39;s a lot of overlap with politics
[00:11:42] so I&#39;m just trying to avoid that but it
[00:11:44] seems like he&#39;s saying that it might be
[00:11:45] like a cultural issue but let&#39;s continue
[00:11:48] and see what else they&#39;ve talked about
[00:11:50] yes sir in terms of national security or
[00:11:52] interest have play a role or competition
[00:11:54] with China as well so I was the chairman
[00:11:56] of an AI commission that sort of looked
[00:11:57] at this very carefully and um you can
[00:11:59] read it it&#39;s about 752 pages and I&#39;ll
[00:12:01] just summarize it by saying we&#39;re ahead
[00:12:03] we need to stay ahead and we need lots
[00:12:04] of money to do so our customers were the
[00:12:05] senate in the house um and out of that
[00:12:08] came the chips act and a lot of other
[00:12:09] stuff like that um a rough scenario is
[00:12:12] that the chips act invested billions
[00:12:14] into building out the US infrastructure
[00:12:16] to develop AI chips and also I believe
[00:12:18] that&#39;s what limited a lot of the
[00:12:20] nvidia&#39;s export to China some of the
[00:12:23] best chips the most powerful chips it
[00:12:24] limited the exports to China how much
[00:12:27] they could ship and sell in China how it
[00:12:29] seems like that&#39;s creating a bit of a
[00:12:31] black market of people trying to import
[00:12:33] those into China through other means but
[00:12:36] if you assume the frontier models drive
[00:12:37] forward and a few of the open source
[00:12:39] models it&#39;s likely that a very small
[00:12:40] number of companies can play this game
[00:12:42] countries excuse me what are those
[00:12:43] countries or who are they countries with
[00:12:45] a lot of money and a lot of talent
[00:12:46] strong Educational Systems and a
[00:12:47] willingness to win the US is one of them
[00:12:49] China is another one how many others are
[00:12:51] there are there any
[00:12:52] others I don&#39;t know maybe but certainly
[00:12:55] the in your lifetimes the battle between
[00:12:57] the US and China for knowledge Supremacy
[00:12:59] is going to be the big fight right so
[00:13:01] the US government banned essentially the
[00:13:02] Invidia chips although they weren&#39;t
[00:13:03] allowed to say that was what they were
[00:13:04] doing but they actually did that into
[00:13:05] China um they have about a 10year chip
[00:13:08] advant we have a roughly 10e chip
[00:13:09] advantage in terms of subdv is sub five
[00:13:12] roughly 10 years wow um and so you&#39;re
[00:13:14] gonna have so an example would be today
[00:13:16] we&#39;re a couple of years ahead of China
[00:13:17] my guess is we&#39;ll get a few more years
[00:13:18] ahead of China and the Chinese are
[00:13:20] whopping mad about this it&#39;s like hugely
[00:13:21] upset about it so that&#39;s a big deal that
[00:13:23] was a decision made by the Trump
[00:13:24] Administration and furthered by the
[00:13:25] Biden Administration do you think that
[00:13:27] it&#39;s going to make that scale of
[00:13:28] investment I mean OB the chips act but
[00:13:29] beyond that build building a massive AI
[00:13:32] system so so as you know I I lead a an
[00:13:34] informal ad hoc non-legal group that&#39;s
[00:13:37] that&#39;s different from illegal exactly
[00:13:39] justar which includes all the usual
[00:13:41] which includes all The Usual Suspects
[00:13:43] yes and The Usual Suspects over the last
[00:13:44] year came up with basis of the reasoning
[00:13:46] that became the um uh uh the B
[00:13:49] administration&#39;s uh AI act which is the
[00:13:51] longest Presidential Directive in
[00:13:53] history you&#39;re talking the special
[00:13:53] competitive studies Pro no this is the
[00:13:55] actual the actual act from the executive
[00:13:58] office and there implementing the
[00:13:59] details so far they&#39;ve got it right and
[00:14:01] so for example one of the debates that
[00:14:02] we had for last year has been how do you
[00:14:05] detect danger in a system which has
[00:14:07] learned it but you don&#39;t know what to
[00:14:09] ask it okay so in other words it&#39;s a
[00:14:11] core it&#39;s a sort of a core problem it&#39;s
[00:14:12] learned something bad but it can&#39;t tell
[00:14:14] you what it learned and you don&#39;t know
[00:14:15] what to ask it and there&#39;s so many
[00:14:16] threats right like it learned how to mix
[00:14:18] chemistry in some new way but you don&#39;t
[00:14:19] know how to ask it and so people are
[00:14:21] working hard on that but we ultimately
[00:14:22] wrote in our memos to them that there
[00:14:24] was a threshold which we arbitrarily
[00:14:25] named as 10 to the 26 flops which
[00:14:27] technically is a measure of computation
[00:14:29] that that threshold you had to report to
[00:14:31] the government that you were doing this
[00:14:32] and that&#39;s part of the rule the EU to
[00:14:35] just make sure they were different did
[00:14:36] 10 to 25 yeah but it&#39;s all kind of close
[00:14:38] enough I think all of these distinctions
[00:14:39] go away because the technology will now
[00:14:41] the technical term is called Federated
[00:14:42] training where basically you can take
[00:14:43] pieces and Union them together so we may
[00:14:46] not be able to keep keep people safe
[00:14:48] from these new things well rumors are
[00:14:49] that that&#39;s how open ey has had to train
[00:14:50] partly because of the power uh
[00:14:51] consumption there&#39;s no one place where
[00:14:53] so this is interesting I haven&#39;t heard
[00:14:55] that specific terminology before so he&#39;s
[00:14:57] saying that you can kind of build
[00:14:58] different pie pieces of LMS or sort of
[00:15:00] AI systems you train those pieces
[00:15:02] separately and then you Union them
[00:15:05] together you glue them together we&#39;ve
[00:15:06] seen this with the recent paper
[00:15:08] published where you can take sort of the
[00:15:09] large smart model and a very like a
[00:15:11] cheaper faster model and have sort of
[00:15:14] another sort of gatekeeper another yet
[00:15:16] another a model that kind of chooses
[00:15:17] where it routes the questions to so
[00:15:20] certain questions need to be answered by
[00:15:21] the bigger model but there&#39;s a lot that
[00:15:23] can be answered just as effectively by
[00:15:26] the smaller model and so this model just
[00:15:27] routes them to the cheaper model when
[00:15:29] needed and the results have been
[00:15:31] astonishing because it&#39;s if I remember
[00:15:33] my numbers correctly it has shown in
[00:15:35] some cases to reduce the cost of running
[00:15:37] these things by 80% while maintaining
[00:15:40] something like 96% accuracy so for just
[00:15:43] and I don&#39;t recall those the exact
[00:15:45] numbers but it was some big big numbers
[00:15:46] like that so it&#39;s a tiny reduction in
[00:15:48] accuracy for a potentially massive
[00:15:51] reduction in cost so I&#39;m not sure if
[00:15:53] that&#39;s an example of specifically what
[00:15:55] he&#39;s talking about but this idea of
[00:15:56] Federated training sounds like it&#39;s
[00:15:58] training piece in individual sort of
[00:16:00] batches right and taking those pieces
[00:16:02] and then putting them together to create
[00:16:04] the final model next they&#39;re talking
[00:16:06] about war well let&#39;s talk to about a
[00:16:08] real war that&#39;s going on I know that uh
[00:16:10] something you&#39;ve been very involved in
[00:16:11] is uh the Ukraine war and in particular
[00:16:15] uh I know that uh something you&#39;ve been
[00:16:17] very involved in is uh the Ukraine war
[00:16:19] and in particular uh I how you talk
[00:16:21] about white stor and your your goal of
[00:16:23] having a 500,000 $500 drones destroy $5
[00:16:26] million tanks so Howes that changing
[00:16:28] Warfare I work for the Secretary of
[00:16:29] Defense for seven years and and tried to
[00:16:32] change the way we run our military I&#39;m
[00:16:34] I&#39;m not a particularly big fan of the
[00:16:35] military but it&#39;s very expensive and I
[00:16:36] wanted to see if I could be helpful and
[00:16:37] I think in my view I largely failed they
[00:16:38] gave me a medal so they must give medals
[00:16:41] to failure or you know whatever but my
[00:16:43] self-criticism was nothing has really
[00:16:44] changed and the system in America is not
[00:16:47] going to lead to real Innovation so
[00:16:49] watching the Russians use tanks to
[00:16:51] destroy apartment buildings with little
[00:16:52] old ladies and kids just drove me crazy
[00:16:54] so I decided to work on a company with
[00:16:55] your friend Sebastian thrun and as a
[00:16:57] former faculty member here and a bunch
[00:16:59] of Stanford people and the idea
[00:17:01] basically is to do two things use AI in
[00:17:03] complicated powerful ways for these
[00:17:04] essentially robotic War and the second
[00:17:06] one is to lower the cost of the robots
[00:17:07] now you sit there and you go why would a
[00:17:09] good liberal like me do that and the
[00:17:10] answer is that the whole theory of
[00:17:13] armies is tanks artilleries and Mort and
[00:17:15] we can eliminate all of them and we can
[00:17:17] make the penalty for invading a country
[00:17:18] at least by lamb essentially being
[00:17:20] impossible it should eliminate the kind
[00:17:22] of land battles well this this is Rel
[00:17:23] question is that does it give more of
[00:17:25] advantage to defense versus offense can
[00:17:26] you can you even make that distinction
[00:17:27] because I&#39;ve been doing this for the
[00:17:28] last year I&#39;ve learned a lot about war
[00:17:29] that I really did not want to know and
[00:17:31] one of the things to know about war is
[00:17:32] that the offense always has the
[00:17:33] advantage because you can always
[00:17:35] overwhelm the defensive systems and so
[00:17:37] you&#39;re better off as a strategy of
[00:17:38] National Defense to have a very strong
[00:17:40] offense that you can use if you need to
[00:17:42] and the systems that I and others are
[00:17:43] building will do that um because of the
[00:17:45] way the system works I now a licensed I
[00:17:47] think he might have misspoken there let
[00:17:48] me know in the comments if you think so
[00:17:50] too or I&#39;m missing something I think he
[00:17:52] meant to say that he will he and others
[00:17:54] like him will build incredible defensive
[00:17:57] systems to reduce the effectiveness of
[00:17:59] invading and using offensive systems
[00:18:01] that&#39;s how I&#39;m interpreting I think he
[00:18:03] kind of to me it sounds like he misspoke
[00:18:04] a little bit if if I understand
[00:18:05] correctly because of the way the system
[00:18:07] works I am now a licensed arms deer
[00:18:10] others are building we do that um
[00:18:11] because of the way the system works I am
[00:18:13] now a licensed arms dealer so computer
[00:18:15] scientist businessman arms dealer and
[00:18:19] I&#39;m sorry to agression I I don&#39;t know I
[00:18:21] do not recommend this in your Carew I
[00:18:22] stick with they are um and because of
[00:18:24] the way the laws work um we&#39;re doing
[00:18:25] this privately and then it&#39;s this is all
[00:18:27] legal with the support of the
[00:18:28] governments it goes straight into
[00:18:28] Ukraine and then they fight the war and
[00:18:30] and and without going into all the
[00:18:31] details things are pretty bad I think if
[00:18:33] in May or June if the Russians build up
[00:18:36] as they expecting to Ukraine will lose a
[00:18:38] whole chunk of its territory and will
[00:18:39] begin the process of losing the whole
[00:18:40] country so I believe this was recorded
[00:18:42] in August 2024 just a few days ago or at
[00:18:45] least that&#39;s when it was posted if you
[00:18:47] recall the news headlines about it all
[00:18:49] of them are from like a few hours ago so
[00:18:51] I think he&#39;s talking about 2025 I&#39;m
[00:18:54] assuming so he&#39;s talking about May or
[00:18:55] June of 2025 for most of History humans
[00:18:58] sort of had a mystical understanding of
[00:18:59] the universe and then there&#39;s the
[00:19:00] Scientific Revolution and the
[00:19:01] enlightenment um and in your article you
[00:19:03] argue that now these models are becoming
[00:19:05] so complicated and uh difficult to
[00:19:08] understand that we don&#39;t really know
[00:19:09] what&#39;s going on in them I&#39;ll take a
[00:19:11] quote from Richard fean he says what I
[00:19:12] cannot create I do not understand I saw
[00:19:13] this quote the other day but now people
[00:19:15] are creating things they do not that
[00:19:16] that they can create but they don&#39;t
[00:19:16] really understand what&#39;s inside of them
[00:19:17] is the nature of knowledge changing in a
[00:19:19] way are we gonna have to start just
[00:19:20] taking the word for these models without
[00:19:22] them able being able to explain it to us
[00:19:23] the analogy I would offer is to
[00:19:24] teenagers if you have a teenager you
[00:19:26] know that they&#39;re human but you can&#39;t
[00:19:27] quite figure out what they&#39;re thinking
[00:19:29] um but somehow we&#39;ve managed in society
[00:19:30] to adapt to the presence of teenagers
[00:19:32] right and they eventually grow out of
[00:19:33] that and this serious so it&#39;s probably
[00:19:35] the case we&#39;re going to have knowledge
[00:19:37] systems that we cannot fully
[00:19:38] characterize but we understand their
[00:19:40] boundaries right we understand the
[00:19:42] limits of what they can do and that&#39;s
[00:19:43] probably the best outcome we can get do
[00:19:44] you think we&#39;ll understand the limits we
[00:19:46] we&#39;ll get pretty good at it the
[00:19:47] consensus of my group that meets on
[00:19:49] every week is that eventually the way
[00:19:51] you&#39;ll do this it&#39;s called SOC called
[00:19:52] adversarial AI is that there will there
[00:19:54] will actually be companies that you will
[00:19:56] hire and pay money to to break your AI
[00:19:58] system so it&#39;ll be the r instead of
[00:19:59] human red teams which is what they do
[00:20:00] today you&#39;ll have whole companies and a
[00:20:02] whole industry of AI systems whose jobs
[00:20:04] are to break the existing AI systems and
[00:20:05] find their vulnerabilities especially
[00:20:07] the knowledge that they have that we
[00:20:08] can&#39;t figure out that makes sense to me
[00:20:09] it&#39;s also a great project for you here
[00:20:11] at Stanford because if you have a
[00:20:12] graduate student who has to figure out
[00:20:13] how to attack one of these large models
[00:20:15] and understand what it does that is a
[00:20:16] great skill to build the Next Generation
[00:20:18] so it makes sense to me that the two
[00:20:19] will travel together if that&#39;s something
[00:20:21] that interests you there&#39;s a Twitter SLX
[00:20:23] account Pini The prompter Who uh
[00:20:25] basically jailbreaks a lot of these
[00:20:27] models usually within a few days of
[00:20:28] their release so he&#39;s just of course one
[00:20:30] of uh many people that do sort of things
[00:20:33] like that he does it kind of simly for
[00:20:35] entertainment and for online media
[00:20:38] Clouts but if you think about it third
[00:20:40] party testing third party red teaming of
[00:20:43] AI models third party quality assurance
[00:20:45] right QA of these models as they roll
[00:20:48] out and have contact with consumers with
[00:20:50] businesses with organizations Etc as
[00:20:52] well as just with various infrastructure
[00:20:54] systems and factories automations Etc
[00:20:57] war of course that&#39;s going to be a Big
[00:20:58] Industry that doesn&#39;t really exist yet
[00:21:01] it it just is beginning to grow and yet
[00:21:04] that might be something interesting and
[00:21:06] profitable to get into if that&#39;s uh
[00:21:08] that&#39;s your cup of tea next he comments
[00:21:10] just a bit on adver serial AI you just
[00:21:13] mentioned adversarial I&#39;m wonder if
[00:21:15] elaborate on that more it seems to be
[00:21:16] besides obviously increase get more
[00:21:18] perform mod getting them to do what you
[00:21:20] want
[00:21:22] isue well you have to assume that the
[00:21:24] current hallucination problems become
[00:21:26] less right in as the technology gets
[00:21:28] better and so forth I&#39;m not suggesting
[00:21:29] it goes away and then you also have to
[00:21:31] assume that there are tests for efficacy
[00:21:33] so there has to be a way of knowing that
[00:21:34] the thing succeeded so in the example
[00:21:36] that I gave of the Tik Tok competitor
[00:21:37] and by the way I was not arguing that
[00:21:38] you should illegally steal everybody&#39;s
[00:21:39] music what you would do if you&#39;re a
[00:21:40] silicon value entrepreneur which
[00:21:41] hopefully all of you will be is if it
[00:21:43] took off then you&#39;d hire a whole bunch
[00:21:44] of lawyers to go clean the mess up right
[00:21:45] but if if nobody uses your product it
[00:21:47] doesn&#39;t matter that you stole all the
[00:21:48] content and do not quote me right right
[00:21:51] you&#39;re on camera that&#39;s right but you
[00:21:53] see my point in other words Silicon
[00:21:54] Valley will run these tests and clean up
[00:21:55] the mess and that&#39;s typically how those
[00:21:56] things are done so so my own View is
[00:21:58] that you&#39;ll see more and more um
[00:22:00] performative systems with even better
[00:22:02] test and eventually adversarial tests
[00:22:03] and that&#39;ll keep it within a box the
[00:22:05] technical term is called Chain of
[00:22:06] Thought reasoning and people believe
[00:22:07] that in the next few years you&#39;ll be
[00:22:09] able to generate a thousand steps of
[00:22:10] Chain of Thought reasoning right do this
[00:22:12] do this it&#39;s like building recipes right
[00:22:13] that the recipes you can run the recipe
[00:22:15] and you can actually test that It
[00:22:16] produced the correct outcome and that&#39;s
[00:22:17] how the system will work next they ask
[00:22:19] what&#39;s going to be driving AI progress
[00:22:20] is it more data more compute is it just
[00:22:23] like chips and Hardware the amounts of
[00:22:24] money being thrown around are
[00:22:26] mindboggling and um I&#39;ve chose I
[00:22:29] essentially invest in everything because
[00:22:30] I can&#39;t figure out who&#39;s going to win
[00:22:31] and the amounts of money that are
[00:22:33] following me are so large I think some
[00:22:35] of it is because the early money has
[00:22:36] been made and the big money people who
[00:22:37] don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing have to
[00:22:38] have an AI component and everything is
[00:22:40] now an AI investment so they can&#39;t tell
[00:22:41] the difference I Define ai as Learning
[00:22:43] Systems systems that actually learn so I
[00:22:44] think that&#39;s one of them the second is
[00:22:46] that there are very sophisticated new
[00:22:47] algorithms that are sort of post
[00:22:48] Transformers my friend my collaborator
[00:22:50] for a long time has invented a new non-
[00:22:51] Transformer architecture there&#39;s a group
[00:22:53] that I&#39;m funding in Paris that has
[00:22:54] claims to done the same thing so there&#39;s
[00:22:56] enormous invention there a lot of things
[00:22:57] at Stanford and the final thing is that
[00:22:59] there is a belief in the market that the
[00:23:01] invention of intelligence has infinite
[00:23:03] return so let&#39;s say you have you put $50
[00:23:05] billion of capital into a company you
[00:23:07] have to make an awful lot of money from
[00:23:08] intelligence to pay that back I mean
[00:23:10] when you phrase it like that it seems to
[00:23:11] make sense if you invent intelligence
[00:23:14] certainly that would have an infinite
[00:23:17] return so it&#39;s probably the case that
[00:23:18] we&#39;ll go through some huge investment
[00:23:20] bubble and then it&#39;ll sort itself out
[00:23:21] that&#39;s always been true in the past and
[00:23:23] it&#39;s likely to be true here and what you
[00:23:24] said earlier was you think that the
[00:23:26] leaders are pulling away from right now
[00:23:27] right now and and
[00:23:29] this is a really the question is roughly
[00:23:31] the following there&#39;s a company called
[00:23:32] mrr in France they done a really good
[00:23:34] job um and I&#39;m obviously an investor um
[00:23:36] they have produced their second version
[00:23:38] their third model is likely to be closed
[00:23:39] because it&#39;s so expensive they need
[00:23:41] revenue and they can&#39;t give their model
[00:23:42] away so this open source versus closed
[00:23:44] Source debate in our industry is huge
[00:23:46] and um my entire career was based on
[00:23:49] people being willing to share software
[00:23:50] in open source everything about me is
[00:23:52] open source much of Google&#39;s
[00:23:53] underpinnings were open source
[00:23:54] everything I&#39;ve done technically and yet
[00:23:56] it may be that the capital costs which
[00:23:57] are so immense fundamentally changes how
[00:23:59] software is built you and I were talking
[00:24:01] um my own view of software programmers
[00:24:03] is that software programmers
[00:24:04] productivity will at least double there
[00:24:05] are three or four software companies
[00:24:07] that are trying to do that I&#39;ve invested
[00:24:08] in all of them in and they&#39;re all trying
[00:24:10] to make software programmers more
[00:24:11] productive the most interesting one that
[00:24:12] I just met with is called augment and I
[00:24:14] always think of an individual programmer
[00:24:15] and they said that&#39;s not our Target our
[00:24:16] Target are these 100 person software
[00:24:17] programming teams on millions of lines
[00:24:19] of code where nobody knows what&#39;s going
[00:24:20] on that&#39;s a really good AI thing will
[00:24:22] they make money I hope so you mentioned
[00:24:24] that there&#39;s the combination of the
[00:24:25] context exension the agents and the text
[00:24:27] to action is going to unimaginable
[00:24:29] impacts first of all why is the
[00:24:31] combination important and second of all
[00:24:32] I know that you know you&#39;re not like a
[00:24:33] crystal ball and you can&#39;t necessarily
[00:24:35] tell the future but why do you think
[00:24:36] it&#39;s beyond anything that we could
[00:24:37] imagine I think largely because the
[00:24:38] context window allows you to solve the
[00:24:40] problem of recency the current models
[00:24:42] take a year to train roughly six six
[00:24:44] there 18 months six months of
[00:24:45] preparation six months of training six
[00:24:46] months of fine tuning so they&#39;re always
[00:24:47] out of date context window you can feed
[00:24:50] what happened like you can ask it
[00:24:51] questions about the uh the Hamas Israel
[00:24:53] war right in a context that&#39;s very
[00:24:55] powerful it becomes current like Google
[00:24:56] um in the case of Agents I&#39;ll give you
[00:24:58] an example I set up a foundation which
[00:24:59] is funding a nonprofit which starts
[00:25:01] there&#39;s a I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s
[00:25:02] Chemists in the room that I don&#39;t really
[00:25:03] understand chemistry there&#39;s a a tool
[00:25:05] called chro CW which was an LM based
[00:25:08] system that learned chemistry and what
[00:25:09] they do is they run it to generate
[00:25:10] chemistry hypotheses about proteins and
[00:25:12] they have a lab which runs the tests
[00:25:14] overnight and then it learns that&#39;s a
[00:25:16] huge acceleration accelerant in
[00:25:17] chemistry Material Science and so forth
[00:25:19] so that&#39;s that&#39;s an agent model and I
[00:25:21] think the text to action can be
[00:25:21] understood by just having a lot of sheet
[00:25:23] programmers right um and I don&#39;t think
[00:25:25] we understand what happens and this is
[00:25:26] again your area of expertise what happen
[00:25:28] happens when everyone has their own
[00:25:29] programmer I&#39;m not talking about turning
[00:25:30] on and off the lights you know I imagine
[00:25:32] another example um for some reason you
[00:25:34] don&#39;t like Google so you say build me a
[00:25:35] Google competitor yeah you personally
[00:25:37] you don&#39;t build me a Google competitor
[00:25:38] uh search the web build a UI make a good
[00:25:41] copy um add generative AI in an
[00:25:43] interesting way do it in 30 seconds and
[00:25:45] see if it works right so a lot of people
[00:25:49] believe that the incumbents including
[00:25:50] Google are vulnerable to this kind of an
[00:25:52] attack now we&#39;ll see there were a bunch
[00:25:53] of questions who were sent over by
[00:25:54] slider I want to give some of them
[00:25:55] upload so um here&#39;s one um we talked a
[00:25:57] little about this last year um how can
[00:25:58] we stop AI from influencing public
[00:25:59] opinion misinformation especially during
[00:26:00] the upcoming he&#39;s asked a bit about
[00:26:02] misinformation how can we prevent AI
[00:26:05] from causing misinformation he talks
[00:26:07] about how during his time working with
[00:26:08] YouTube that was a problem people would
[00:26:10] upload a video for profit for their own
[00:26:13] self-gain and as a result of
[00:26:15] misinformation he says well people could
[00:26:17] be hurt he even says people die so
[00:26:19] certainly that is a problem if you saw
[00:26:22] my yesterday&#39;s video about grock 2 and
[00:26:24] the images it generates they&#39;re very re
[00:26:26] looking and grock 2 does not seem to
[00:26:29] have any sort of safety rails in place
[00:26:31] it just generates whatever you ask for
[00:26:33] so heading into the selection certainly
[00:26:35] that could be an issue he talks a little
[00:26:37] bit about some sort of a digital
[00:26:38] authentication or a public key
[00:26:40] authentication basically if somebody
[00:26:42] like the president speaks there&#39;s some
[00:26:44] key that everybody else can verify
[00:26:46] saying okay this is him this is his
[00:26:48] original audio he mentions briefly that
[00:26:50] it&#39;s it seems like he&#39;s saying it&#39;s a
[00:26:51] shame that the American universities
[00:26:53] aren&#39;t getting as much resources for
[00:26:56] computes for Google cloud and other
[00:26:58] places like that and this explosion
[00:27:00] where all the big companies are
[00:27:01] basically gobbling up the available
[00:27:03] resources and so he&#39;s saying the right
[00:27:05] thing for us to do is to get them the
[00:27:07] resources they need to give the
[00:27:08] universities the compute the resources
[00:27:10] that they need to pursue research and
[00:27:12] development and all that stuff next they
[00:27:13] talk about automation who&#39;s getting
[00:27:15] replaced who&#39;s getting to be obsolete in
[00:27:18] the labor force so let&#39;s take a look at
[00:27:20] that really fast I&#39;ll defer to the real
[00:27:22] expert here uh as your amateur Economist
[00:27:24] taught by Eric um I I fundamentally
[00:27:27] believe that the the sort of college
[00:27:28] education High skills task will be fine
[00:27:30] because people will work with these
[00:27:31] systems I think the systems is no
[00:27:33] different from any other technology wave
[00:27:34] the dangerous jobs and the jobs which
[00:27:35] require very little human judgment will
[00:27:37] get replaced the next question is kind
[00:27:39] of like the global balance of AI power
[00:27:42] so the person asking the question
[00:27:43] specifically mentions us and China but
[00:27:46] as you see here Eric specifically
[00:27:48] focuses on India take a listen the most
[00:27:50] interesting country is India because the
[00:27:52] top AI people come from India to the us
[00:27:54] and we should let India keep some of its
[00:27:56] top talent not all of them but some of
[00:27:57] them um and they don&#39;t have the kind of
[00:27:58] training facilities and programs that we
[00:28:00] so richly have here to me India is the
[00:28:01] big swing state in that regard China&#39;s
[00:28:03] Lost it&#39;s not going to not going to come
[00:28:04] back they&#39;re not going to change the
[00:28:05] regime as much as people wish them to do
[00:28:07] Japan and Korea are clearly in our camp
[00:28:09] Taiwan is a fantastic country whose
[00:28:11] software is terrible so that&#39;s not gonna
[00:28:12] going to work um amazing hard and in the
[00:28:15] rest of the world there are not a lot of
[00:28:16] other good choices that are big German
[00:28:18] the Europe is screwed up because of
[00:28:19] Brussels it&#39;s not a new fact I spent 10
[00:28:20] years fighting them and I work really
[00:28:22] hard to get them to fix the the EU act
[00:28:24] and they still have all the restrictions
[00:28:26] that make it very difficult to do our
[00:28:27] kind of research in Europe my French
[00:28:28] friends have spent all their time
[00:28:29] battling Brussels and mcon who&#39;s a
[00:28:31] personal friend is fighting hard for
[00:28:33] this and so France I think has a chance
[00:28:34] I don&#39;t see I don&#39;t see Germany coming
[00:28:35] and the rest is not big
[00:28:36] enough yes ma&#39;am so I know you&#39;re an
[00:28:39] engineer by
[00:28:40] trainer um given the capabilities that
[00:28:43] you Enis these mod should we still spend
[00:28:44] Hing to yeah because because ultimately
[00:28:46] it&#39;s it&#39;s the old thing of why do you
[00:28:47] study English if you can speak English
[00:28:49] you get better at it right you really do
[00:28:50] need to understand how these systems
[00:28:51] work and I feel very strong yes sir yeah
[00:28:53] I&#39;m curious if you explore good answer
[00:28:55] distributed setting and I&#39;m asking
[00:28:56] because sure like making a large cluster
[00:28:58] but Ma are powerful there&#39;s a lot of
[00:28:59] small maches across the world so like
[00:29:01] you think like folding at home are a
[00:29:02] similar idea works for training yeah we
[00:29:04] look very hard this so the way the
[00:29:06] algorithms work is you have a very large
[00:29:07] Matrix and you have essentially a
[00:29:08] multiplication function so think of it
[00:29:10] as going back and forth and back and
[00:29:12] forth and these systems are completely
[00:29:13] limited by the speed of memory to CPU or
[00:29:15] GPU and in fact the next iteration of
[00:29:18] Nvidia chips has combined all those
[00:29:20] functions into one chip the chips are
[00:29:21] now so big that they glue them all
[00:29:22] together and in fact the package is so
[00:29:24] sensitive the package is put together in
[00:29:26] a clean room as well as the chip itself
[00:29:27] so the looks like supercomputers and
[00:29:29] speed of light especially memory
[00:29:31] interconnect really dominated so I think
[00:29:32] unlikely for a while is there a way to
[00:29:33] segment the element like so Jeff de last
[00:29:35] year when he spoke here talked about
[00:29:36] having these different parts of it you
[00:29:38] train separately and then kind of
[00:29:39] Federate them each you know in order to
[00:29:41] do that you&#39;d have to have 10 million
[00:29:42] such things and then you&#39;re the way you
[00:29:44] ask the questions would be too slow he&#39;s
[00:29:45] talking about eight or 10 12 not at Lev
[00:29:49] the back way back I know like after
[00:29:51] releas new yor time open using work for
[00:29:53] training do you think
[00:29:54] that&#39;s I used to do a lot of work on the
[00:29:56] music licensing stuff what I learned was
[00:29:58] that in the 60s there was a series of
[00:30:00] lawsuits that resulted in an agreement
[00:30:02] where you get a a stipulated royalty
[00:30:04] whenever your song is played even even
[00:30:06] they don&#39;t even know who you are so paid
[00:30:07] into a bank and my guess is it&#39;ll be the
[00:30:08] same thing there be lots of lawsuits and
[00:30:09] there&#39;ll be some kind of stipulated
[00:30:10] agreement which will just say you have
[00:30:12] to pay x per of whatever Revenue you
[00:30:14] have in order to use pass cap BMI cap
[00:30:16] BMI look them up it&#39;s long it will seem
[00:30:17] very old to you but I think that&#39;s how
[00:30:18] it will yes sir interesting like there&#39;s
[00:30:21] a few players that are dominating AI
[00:30:23] right they&#39;ll continue to dominate and
[00:30:24] they seem to overlap with the large
[00:30:25] companies that all the antitrust
[00:30:27] regulation is kind of focus on how do
[00:30:28] you see those two Trends kind of yeah
[00:30:30] like do you see Regulators breaking up
[00:30:31] these companies and how will that affect
[00:30:33] the yeah so in my career I helped
[00:30:36] Microsoft get broken up and it wasn&#39;t
[00:30:37] broken up and I fought fought for Google
[00:30:39] to not be broken up and it&#39;s not been
[00:30:40] broken up so it sure looks to me like
[00:30:41] the trend is not to be broken up um as
[00:30:43] long as the companies avoid being John D
[00:30:45] Rockefeller the senior and I studied
[00:30:46] this looked it up it&#39;s how antitrust law
[00:30:48] came I don&#39;t think the government is
[00:30:49] will act the re the reason you&#39;re seeing
[00:30:51] these large companies dominate is who
[00:30:52] has the capital to build these data
[00:30:54] centers right right so my friend Reed
[00:30:56] and my friend com
[00:30:58] two have we talked to you about the
[00:31:00] decision that they made to take
[00:31:01] inflection so I believe Mustafa he&#39;s
[00:31:02] talking about Mustafa siman who is the
[00:31:04] co-founder of Google Deep Mind friend
[00:31:06] Reed and my friend M coming next we two
[00:31:08] week have Reed talked to you about the
[00:31:10] decision that they made to take
[00:31:11] inflection and essentially PE part it
[00:31:12] into Microsoft basically they decided
[00:31:14] they couldn&#39;t raise the tens of billions
[00:31:15] of dollars is that number public that
[00:31:16] you mentioned earlier have
[00:31:18] have
[00:31:20] got we want
[00:31:24] this I was wondering where all this is
[00:31:26] going to leave countries where in b
[00:31:27] ipants in phun models and access to
[00:31:30] compu the rich get richer and the poor
[00:31:32] do the best they can um they&#39;ll have to
[00:31:34] the fact of the matter is this is a rich
[00:31:36] country&#39;s game right huge Capital lots
[00:31:38] of technically strong people strong
[00:31:39] government support right there are two
[00:31:41] examples there lots of other countries
[00:31:43] that have all sorts of problems they
[00:31:43] don&#39;t have those resources they&#39;ll have
[00:31:44] to find a partner they&#39;ll have to join
[00:31:46] with somebody else something like that I
[00:31:48] last we met you he&#39;s fairly blunt he&#39;s
[00:31:50] fairly straightforward he I think kind
[00:31:52] of calls it how he sees it and it really
[00:31:55] seems like he&#39;s not talking one side or
[00:31:56] the other he doesn&#39;t have he&#39;s not
[00:31:58] pumping his back so to speak so he&#39;s not
[00:32:00] saying the things that benefit his
[00:32:01] portfolio or whatever he&#39;s just like
[00:32:03] yeah this is how it&#39;s going to be this
[00:32:04] is how it works by default big companies
[00:32:06] are not going to broken up the rich get
[00:32:07] richer Etc and finally he&#39;s asked a
[00:32:10] little bit more about kind of the
[00:32:11] business and entrepreneur side of things
[00:32:13] if you&#39;re starting your own company you
[00:32:15] have a product idea what does that look
[00:32:16] like how do you develop it how do you
[00:32:18] create a lot of wealth with your own
[00:32:20] product here&#39;s his answer I want I think
[00:32:23] the last we met you you at hackathon at
[00:32:24] AGI house and I know you spent a lot of
[00:32:26] time helping like young people as they
[00:32:27] create a lot of wealth and you spoke
[00:32:28] very passionately about about wanting to
[00:32:30] to do that do you have any advice for
[00:32:31] folks here as they&#39;re building their
[00:32:32] they&#39;re writing their business PL for
[00:32:33] this class or policy proposals or
[00:32:34] research proposals um you know at this
[00:32:36] stage of the careers going forward well
[00:32:39] um I teach a class in the business
[00:32:40] school on this so you should come to my
[00:32:41] class um the I am struck by the speed
[00:32:44] which with which you can build
[00:32:46] demonstrations of new ideas so in that
[00:32:49] in one of the hack I did the winning
[00:32:51] team the command was fly the Drone
[00:32:53] between two towers and it was given a
[00:32:54] virtual drone space and it figured out
[00:32:56] how to fly the Drone what the word
[00:32:57] between them generated the code in
[00:32:58] Python and flew the Drone in the
[00:32:59] simulator through the tower I just it
[00:33:01] would have taken a week or two you know
[00:33:03] good professional programmers to do that
[00:33:05] um I&#39;m telling you that the ability to
[00:33:06] prototype quickly really you know part
[00:33:08] part of the problem being an
[00:33:09] entrepreneur is everything happens
[00:33:10] faster well now if you can&#39;t get your
[00:33:12] prototype built in a day using these
[00:33:14] various tools you need to think about
[00:33:16] that right because that&#39;s who your
[00:33:17] competitor is doing so I guess my
[00:33:18] biggest advice is when you start
[00:33:19] thinking about a company is find the
[00:33:20] right a business CL plan in fact you
[00:33:22] should ask the computer to write your
[00:33:23] business plan for you
[00:33:25] um talk about that after leave it and
[00:33:28] and but I think it&#39;s very important to
[00:33:30] prototype your idea using these tools as
[00:33:32] quickly as you can because you can be
[00:33:33] sure there&#39;s another person doing
[00:33:34] exactly that same thing in another
[00:33:36] company in another University in a place
[00:33:38] that You&#39; all right
[00:33:40] thank very cool so this piece was uh
[00:33:43] taken down so apparently it&#39;s not even
[00:33:44] online right now but hopefully those few
[00:33:47] little Clips give you glips about what
[00:33:49] he thinks of AI you know I&#39;ve kind of
[00:33:51] cut out all the pieces that I think
[00:33:53] caused the controversy or whatever that
[00:33:55] situation was I don&#39;t think it really
[00:33:56] had anything to do with AI or anything
[00:33:58] of of substance I mean maybe touched on
[00:34:01] some political issues but whatever this
[00:34:03] is a person with a lot of really
[00:34:05] technical background and even though
[00:34:07] he&#39;s more of like a business guy he is
[00:34:10] spoken of with a lot of respect by all
[00:34:12] the engineers and all the very highly
[00:34:14] technical people in the Bay Area in the
[00:34:16] Silicon Valley he&#39;s somebody that really
[00:34:17] understands the tech space looks like
[00:34:19] Forbes has him listed as having a netw
[00:34:21] worth of almost $24 billion he&#39;s good
[00:34:25] friends he said with Sam Alman president
[00:34:27] of France France sounds like he knows
[00:34:29] all the co-founders of various AI
[00:34:31] companies big and small I mean this is
[00:34:33] somebody that&#39;s very very on the inside
[00:34:35] this is somebody that knows where things
[00:34:37] are going so certainly when he says
[00:34:39] something I tend to listen I put a great
[00:34:41] deal of weight into what he&#39;s saying and
[00:34:43] what he&#39;s saying is this AI wave is just
[00:34:47] starting we have two massive countries
[00:34:49] two big countries with the capital and
[00:34:50] the talent and everything else that&#39;s
[00:34:52] needed that are vying for AI Supremacy
[00:34:54] the issues with the chips and the power
[00:34:56] and the data while those are bottlenecks
[00:34:59] it seems like they will slowly be
[00:35:01] perhaps even maybe not that slowly
[00:35:03] slowly but but be improved you mentioned
[00:35:05] building data centers and various other
[00:35:07] AI infrastructure in Canada potentially
[00:35:10] which makes a lot of sense if you think
[00:35:12] about it lots of open land tends to be
[00:35:14] colder which again you know Heating and
[00:35:17] the generation of heat and having to
[00:35:19] cool these facilities is a concern tons
[00:35:22] land very friendly government to the US
[00:35:24] you know in factorio how do you just
[00:35:26] like find a big chunk of the map where
[00:35:28] there&#39;s a lot of open land and you&#39;d
[00:35:30] build all your nuclear power plants
[00:35:32] you&#39;d build out your entire like
[00:35:34] electricity infrastructure there just
[00:35:36] have a cable going back to where you
[00:35:38] need electricity to be it begs the
[00:35:40] question is this the future of Canada
[00:35:42] I&#39;m only kidding of course folks but the
[00:35:45] more and more I think about it there is
[00:35:46] a lot of land it&#39;s close by and it&#39;s
[00:35:49] cold and certainly that would be
[00:35:51] phenomenal for the revenue of Canada to
[00:35:53] generate some sort of tax some sort of
[00:35:55] Revenue based on right one of the kind
[00:35:57] of superpowers building out the
[00:35:59] infrastructure it needs to stay dominant
[00:36:01] in the AI race right I mean they&#39;re
[00:36:03] talking about creating 100 billion doll
[00:36:06] data centers potentially even the
[00:36:08] estimates a size 300 billion so that&#39;s
[00:36:10] that&#39;s one company that&#39;s not even the
[00:36:12] US government supported projects that&#39;s
[00:36:15] just a publicly traded company doing
[00:36:17] that sounds like he&#39;s really believing
[00:36:19] in Nvidia and the power of Nvidia and
[00:36:21] it&#39;s Cuda sort of software that the
[00:36:24] chips run on and if I&#39;m understanding
[00:36:26] him correctly he&#39;s not really seeing any
[00:36:28] competition to that I mean there&#39;s some
[00:36:30] things in the Horizon maybe possibly but
[00:36:32] nothing yet so it sounds like a lot of
[00:36:35] this money like a lot of it will be
[00:36:36] flowing into Nvidia and of course this
[00:36:39] idea that as the context window expands
[00:36:41] it&#39;ll become more and more sort of
[00:36:44] similar to training in a sense that
[00:36:46] right if it takes a while to train up a
[00:36:47] model but it can do in context learning
[00:36:50] meaning that you&#39;re able to just upload
[00:36:51] books and stuff to the finished model
[00:36:53] it&#39;s able to learn from them which we&#39;ve
[00:36:54] seen that with Gemini they found a
[00:36:56] language that doesn&#39;t have an a lot of
[00:36:57] online presence only something like 24
[00:37:00] people in the world speak it but they
[00:37:01] have some notebooks and manuscripts and
[00:37:03] stuff like that they uploaded to gini
[00:37:05] the actual finished trained Gemini and
[00:37:08] that model was able to learn how to
[00:37:11] speak it how to create sentences in it
[00:37:13] it wasn&#39;t trained on it it would learned
[00:37:15] in context right so as the context
[00:37:18] window ramps up to 10 million tokens
[00:37:21] that certainly seems like it would
[00:37:22] change how we think about pre- and
[00:37:25] posttraining or in other words once the
[00:37:27] model is trained it doesn&#39;t stop
[00:37:29] learning if you wanted to learn about a
[00:37:31] specific thing that you wanted to learn
[00:37:33] about maybe it&#39;s you know you have a
[00:37:34] company or that that have millions of
[00:37:37] documents and procedures and stuff like
[00:37:39] that just kind of like everywhere but no
[00:37:41] one person understands all of it well in
[00:37:43] the past that was kind of useless it
[00:37:45] doesn&#39;t really help you but if you can
[00:37:47] upload it to a model like that all of a
[00:37:49] sudden it knows all those things about
[00:37:51] your company it can train people on it
[00:37:54] it can answer your questions it can kind
[00:37:55] of manage it update see if there&#39;s any
[00:37:58] conflicts anywhere in it so instead of
[00:38:00] training a brand new model on that you
[00:38:02] just use an existing model and upload
[00:38:04] that stuff into the 10 million token
[00:38:07] context window combine that with text to
[00:38:09] action which is another word I&#39;ve heard
[00:38:11] it before this phrase but it&#39;s not that
[00:38:14] often used I feel like but yeah I mean
[00:38:16] that&#39;s what agents are basically right
[00:38:18] it&#39;s text to action you type in impr
[00:38:21] prompt and it goes and does that action
[00:38:23] it does the thing you&#39;re asking it to do
[00:38:25] as they get better at long-term plan
[00:38:27] long-term reasoning and actually Deep
[00:38:29] Mind CEO de saabi is also just had an
[00:38:32] interview talking about something very
[00:38:34] very similar he&#39;s talking about this
[00:38:36] idea that as agents become better
[00:38:38] long-term reasoners and planners they
[00:38:40] will become better and better at
[00:38:42] carrying out those long Horizon tasks
[00:38:44] and he&#39;s saying we&#39;re not ready for it
[00:38:46] when everybody can have these qualified
[00:38:49] capable agents right he&#39;s saying it&#39;s
[00:38:51] going to have an impact on the world at
[00:38:53] a scale no one understands yet and that
[00:38:56] certainly I think is true that&#39;s
[00:38:58] certainly something that I fully agree
[00:39:00] with a lot of our social structures and
[00:39:03] stuff we&#39;re kind of used to will have to
[00:39:05] change and of course he&#39;s saying if
[00:39:06] you&#39;re worried about losing your job
[00:39:08] having a degree that&#39;s going to become
[00:39:09] worthless you know should you still
[00:39:11] learn to code he&#39;s saying business as
[00:39:13] usual there yes some easy simple jobs or
[00:39:16] maybe very dangerous jobs jobs where
[00:39:18] there&#39;s not a lot of hard decisions to
[00:39:20] be made yes those might go away and yes
[00:39:23] these AIS might be pretty good at coding
[00:39:25] creating projects but learning all those
[00:39:27] skills getting better at those skills
[00:39:28] learning how everything works that&#39;s
[00:39:30] that&#39;s not going out of fashion that&#39;s
[00:39:32] never going to just disappear his
[00:39:34] example was you know if you can speak
[00:39:36] English why would you learn English
[00:39:38] right why would you study English well
[00:39:40] it&#39;s to get better at it to improve your
[00:39:42] abilities with it so I hope you enjoyed
[00:39:44] that make sure you subscribed please
[00:39:46] give me a thumbs up if you enjoyed it my
[00:39:48] name is Wes rth and I&#39;ll see you next
[00:39:49] time thank you for watching
